Encourage your tech-oriented audience to engage with the arts to improve their craft. Finally, mention a current theatre production you recommend and include a related photo.","Something all my friends know about me is that theatre (re!) is one of the great loves of my life.

When I was 6, I got to be a ""snake"" in my town's local production of The Lion King (there were no snakes). A couple of years later, when my dad acted in a play, I got to sit back stage and marvel at the magic of it: a set could be anywhere and (with a bit of talent) you could be anyone. And those lights! 

That love of theatre grew with me, from taking classes in it to turning my keynotes into performances. The AI expert in me writes the script, but it's the thespian in me that works hard to breathe life into it (and into the audience... like the one that made the effort to come see me open the Generative AI Summit at 8:30 AM today in London - sorry it was so early, guys).

I've been asked whether I find it odd to love something so human (theatre), yet spend most of my time working on AI.

Well...



IT'S ALL HUMAN! (!!!)

If you haven't yet learned to see the human behind the AI curtain, here's a blog post for you: https://lnkd.in/e6Uckj8a

For those waiting for AGI to knock on your door and tell you to hand over the keys... one of the best skills you can develop in the AI space is spotting the human parts of the system. Those are weak points where aspirations of usefulness, objectivity, and effectiveness circle the drain, warning us to account for human elements when we design teach. Ignoring (or, worse, actively disbelieving) that AI is a way to amplify a few humans to the benefit or detriment of many is a recipe for disaster. Let's keep an eye on those humans and make sure they have the tools and help they need to create a positive impact rather than a slew of unintended whoopsies.

Technology is a tool for increasing productivity and solving previously unsolvable problems. We're tool-making apes and always have been. AI is incredible, but it's not an either/or between advancing our humanity and advancing our tools. And it's not an either or between art and tech. Plays‚Äîand the arts in general‚Äîare a beautiful place for weaving in tech to tell old stories in new ways.

I had the treat of seeing Dorian Gray recently. Bravo to both Sarah Snook's performance and the use of tech. Screens suspended above the stage showed live video being captured by camera operators on stage, while Snook changed roles and costumes (and beards) without missing a stride. From the book, you'll remember that Dorian is out of control towards the end, beautiful but depraved -- Snook whips out an iPhone and the screen above changes to selfie POV, as Snook slides the face filter up hideously to a fat-lipped bug-eyed Dorian in makeup maximum while hitting the script's crescendo. The audience was in awe. Trust me, that moment was everything theatre aspires to be.

If you're working in tech, I hope you're finding time to make or take in art of some kind. It will make our tech better.

12,"Craft a LinkedIn post inspired by the following insights:

‚ÄúThe path to AGI looks a lot more like curing cancer than developing a vaccine‚Äù - Alexandr Wang, Scale AI CEO

Use this quote to begin the post and introduce a discussion about your perspective on AI and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Express your optimism towards AI and explain why you focus less on questions like ""Is AI smarter than us?"" or ""When will we have AGI?"" Instead, highlight two key areas of your interest:

1. How current AI capabilities can solve new problems.
2. How to build capabilities to steer and harness complex technology.

Refer to a recent report from Bloomberg about OpenAI's five levels to track progress towards AGI. Provide a brief overview of these levels:

- Level 1: Chatbots, AI with conversational language
- Level 2: Reasoners, human-level problem solving
- Level 3: Agents, systems that can take actions
- Level 4: Innovators, AI that can aid in invention
- Level 5: Organizations, AI that can do the work of an organization

Express your curiosity about these developments but also share your skepticism that AI progress can be confined to such a linear framework, especially with vague terms like ""aid in invention."" 

Resonate with Alexandr's perspective that achieving AGI is more akin to the iterative and challenging process of curing cancer than the straightforward development of a vaccine. Emphasize the importance of problem-solving, overcoming roadblocks, and continuous innovation. 

Conclude by asserting that as a species, our strength lies in building tools to solve problems through automation and that focusing on meaningful solutions is more exciting than the mere pursuit of creating something ""smarter"" than humans.

Include a link to hear more from Alexandr Wang and optional commentary that implies skepticism towards grand claims about AI replacing human roles in creative processes. 

Also, highlight the concept that with the right tools, humans become more capable, and position AI as just another powerful tool that scales human potential. Stress the importance of understanding the tool's user and the context of its application.","‚ÄúThe path to AGI looks a lot more like curing cancer than developing a vaccine‚Äù - Alexandr Wang, Scale AI CEO

I am very much an AI optimist. But I don't spend much time thinking about ""Is AI smarter than us?"" or ""when will we have AGI?""

I do, however, spend a great deal of time thinking about: 

1) How current AI capabilities can solve new problems?

and 

2) How we build capabilities to steer and harness complex technology?

Bloomberg reported yesterday that OpenAI has come up with a set of five levels to track its progress towards building AGI (link here: https://lnkd.in/e5Zg6MKM)


- Level 1: Chatbots, AI with conversational language

- Level 2: Reasoners, human-level problem solving

- Level 3: Agents, systems that can take actions

- Level 4: Innovators, AI that can aid in invention

- Level 5: Organizations, AI that can do the work of an organization

I'm curious to hear more from OpenAI, but I have doubts that AI progress will ever fit into such a linear box, especially when none of those fuzzy terms like ""aid in invention""* are properly defined (or at least properly defined for and by those who will use them most).

I more closely resonate with Alexandr's belief that the path to AGI looks more like curing cancer than building a vaccine: solving new problems, running into roadblocks, finding a way to unblock the roadblocks, running into new challenges, rinse and repeat.

We are a tool building species that has been solving problems through automation since the dawn of time. 

Focusing on what we want to solve rather than how fast we make something ""smarter"" (whatever that means*) than us feels a much more exciting and worthy goal.

She created ImageNet, an Internet-scale data set containing 12 million images along with an international competition to see who could build the best model to classify these images. 

At the time, many researchers dismissed ImageNet as being too large and complex. But then in 2012, a University of Toronto student named Alex Krizhevsky proved them wrong with his winning submission AlexNet, which ran on just two NVIDIA GPUs and trounced the next best competitor by a whopping 10.8% margin.

Highlight the importance of evaluation in multi-agent research systems, mention standard evaluation tools for general-purpose foundation models like MMLU, HumanEval, LMSYS Chatbot arena, and HELM, and their limitations. Contrast this with the limited options for evaluating specific LLM-based applications, differentiating between tasks with unambiguous right-or-wrong responses and tasks generating free-text outputs. Emphasize the challenges and current approaches to automated evaluation to avoid reliance on human experts. Conclude abruptly, referencing LinkedIn's length limit and providing a link for further reading.","A barrier to faster progress in generative AI is evaluations (evals), particularly of custom AI  applications that generate free-form text. Let‚Äôs say you have a multi-agent research system that includes a researcher agent and a writer agent. Would adding a fact-checking agent improve the results? If we can‚Äôt efficiently evaluate the impact of such changes, it‚Äôs hard to know which changes to keep.

For evaluating general-purpose foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) ‚Äî which are trained to respond to a large variety of prompts ‚Äî we have standardized tests like MMLU (multiple-choice questions) and HumanEval (testing code generation); the LMSYS Chatbot arena, which pits two LLMs‚Äô responses against each other and asks a human to judge which response is superior; and large-scale benchmarking like HELM. These evaluation tools are invaluable for giving LLM users a sense of different models' relative performance. Nonetheless, they have limitations: For example, leakage of benchmarks datasets‚Äô questions and answers into training data is a constant worry, and human preference for certain answers does not mean those answers are more accurate.

In contrast, our current options for evaluating specific applications built using LLMs are far more limited. Here, I see two major types of applications.
- For applications designed to deliver unambiguous, right-or-wrong responses, we have reasonable options. Let‚Äôs say we want an LLM to read a resume and extract the candidate's most recent job title, or read a customer email and route it to the right department. We can create a test set that comprises ground-truth labeled examples with the right responses, and measure the percentage of times the LLM generates the right output. The main bottleneck is creating the labeled test set, which is expensive but surmountable.
- But many LLM-based applications generate free-text output with no single right response. For example, if we ask an LLM to summarize customer emails, there‚Äôs a multitude of possible good (and bad) responses. The same holds for a system to do web research and write an article about a topic, or a RAG system for answering questions. It‚Äôs impractical to hire an army of human experts to read the LLM‚Äôs outputs every time we tweak the algorithm and evaluate if the answers have improved ‚Äî we need an automated way to test the outputs. Thus, many teams use an advanced language model to evaluate outputs. In the customer email summarization example, we might design an evaluation rubric (scoring criteria) for what makes a good summary. Given an email summary generated by our system, we might prompt an advanced LLM to read it and score it according to our rubric. I‚Äôve found that the results of such a procedure, while better than nothing, can also be noisy ‚Äî sometimes too noisy to reliably tell me if the way I‚Äôve tweaked an algorithm is good or bad.

Think about it: Kids spending eight hours a day interacting with AI friends; adults gravitating to AI romantic partners. I worry that we will look back in five years 10 years and it‚Äôs social media all over again - addictive and ultimately unhealthy.

38,"Generate a LinkedIn post discussing the following points:

- The potential of inexpensive token generation and agentic workflows for Large Language Models (LLMs) in training on synthetic data.
- Why pretraining an LLM on its own generated responses to prompts isn't generally effective, but using agentic workflows might be beneficial.
- The analogy of how humans, like math students, can learn from their own thinking and reflect to improve, and how this might apply to LLMs.
- The three key steps involved in LLM training: (i) pretraining, (ii) instruction fine-tuning, and (iii) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback/Direct Preference Optimization (RLHF/DPO), with emphasis on the vast data requirements for pretraining.
- Examples of LLMs pretraining on massive datasets (e.g., Llama 3 on 15 trillion tokens) and the constant need for more data.
- The issue with models trying to learn from their own output leading to potential model collapse, and how an agentic workflow can mitigate this by generating higher quality output.
- Analogies from other AI applications, such as training a model to play chess with more accurate evaluations or using AI feedback instead of human feedback during alignment.
- The cost considerations for generating synthetic data with current token prices from models like GPT-4-turbo, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama-3-70B on Groq.
- The feasibility of spending on synthetic data generation within the larger budget for training state-of-the-art LLMs, highlighting the potential for agentic workflows to unlock new opportunities. 

Make sure the post is informative and engaging for a LinkedIn audience interested in AI and LLM development. Include real-world cost figures and potential benefits of these methodologies. End with the notion that agentic workflows might be pioneering fresh opportunities for high-quality synthetic data generation.","Inexpensive token generation and agentic workflows for LLMs open up new possibilities for training LLMs on synthetic data. Pretraining an LLM on its own directly generated responses to prompts doesn't help. But if an agentic workflow implemented with the LLM results in higher quality output than the LLM can generate directly, then training on that output becomes potentially useful.

Just as humans can learn from their own thinking, perhaps LLMs can, too.  Imagine a math student learning to write mathematical proofs. By solving a few problems ‚Äî even without external input ‚Äî they can reflect on what works and learn to generate better proofs. 

LLM training involves (i) pretraining (learning from unlabeled text data to predict the next work) followed by (ii) instruction fine-tuning (learning to follow instructions) and (iii) RLHF/DPO to align to human values. Step (i) requires orders of magnitude more data than the others. For example, Llama 3 was pretrained on over 15 trillion tokens. LLM developers are still hungry for more data. Where can we get more text to train on? 

Many developers train smaller models on the output of larger models, so a smaller model learns to mimic a larger model‚Äôs behavior on a particular task. But an LLM can‚Äôt learn much by training on data it generated directly. Indeed, training a model repeatedly on the output of an earlier version of itself can result in model collapse. 

But, an LLM wrapped in an agentic workflow can produce higher-quality output than it can generate directly. This output might be useful as pretraining data.

Efforts like these have precedents:
- When using¬†reinforcement learning to play a game like chess, a model might learn a function that evaluates board positions. If we apply game tree search along with a low-accuracy evaluation function, the model can come up with more accurate evaluations. Then we can train that evaluation function to mimic these more accurate values.
- During alignment, Anthropic‚Äôs constitutional AI uses RLAIF (RL from AI Feedback) to judge LLM output quality, substituting feedback generated by an AI model for human feedback. 

A significant barrier to using agentic workflows to produce LLM training data is the cost of generating tokens. Say we want to generate 1 trillion tokens to extend a pre-existing dataset. At current retail prices, 1 trillion tokens from GPT-4-turbo ($30 per million output tokens), Claude 3 Opus ($75), Gemini 1.5 Pro ($21), and Llama-3-70B on Groq ($0.79) would cost, respectively, $30M, $75M, $21M and $790K. Of course, an agentic workflow would require generating more than one token per final output token. But budgets for training cutting-edge LLMs easily surpass $100M, so spending a few million dollars more for data to boost performance is  feasible. 

That‚Äôs why agentic workflows might opening up new opportunities for high-quality synthetic data generation.

This covers an important shift in RAG (retrieval augmented generation), in which rather than having the developer write explicit routines to retrieve information to feed into the LLM context, we instead build a RAG agent that that has access to tools for retrieving information. This lets the agent decide what information to fetch, and enables it to answer more complex questions using multi-step reasoning.

In detail, you'll learn about:
- Routing: Where your agent will use decision-making to route requests to multiple tools.
- Tool Use: Where you'll create an interface for agents to select what tool (function call) to use as well as generate the right arguments.
- Multi-step reasoning with tool use: Where you'll use an LLM to carry out multiple steps of reasoning, while retaining memory throughout the process.

A fascinating insight from Fei-Fei Li's book, ""The World I See,"" brought this to light, highlighting the foundational role of psychologist Eleanor Rosch in shaping AI as we know it.

üåê WordNet, ImageNet, and Beyond: A Psychological Framework
The creation of ImageNet, a cornerstone in AI's journey, owes its structure to the psychological principles embedded in WordNet. This isn't just about labeling; it's about understanding the intricate web of human thoughts and categorizations - a complex, interconnected tree of ideas. This structure mirrors the human mind's way of organizing information, demonstrating how AI, at its best, reflects the depth of human cognition.

üß† Psychology: The Blueprint for AI's Human-Like Abilities
Eleanor Rosch's work in categorization doesn't just help in image recognition; it extends to natural language processing, decision-making, and emotional intelligence. By integrating such psychological insights, AI not only imitates but also learns like a human, bridging the gap between binary code and human experience.

üí≠ Final Thoughts
Eleanor Rosch's contributions, as emphasized by Fei-Fei Li, serve as a reminder of the interdisciplinary nature of AI. Psychology isn't just a footnote in AI's history; it's a driving force, shaping the very way we envision and create intelligent systems.

This year we set a new bar for inspiring scientific advances, progress in our ML models, moving keynote sessions, creative connections, and a little bit of healthy competition.

There were six takeaways that stood out and propel us forward. Read more below. ‚¨á This week we mark our 6th anniversary at insitro, and I have been reflecting on a question I get asked a lot as a founder: how do you build culture effectively? That task is particularly challenging when building a diverse team comprising members across multiple disciplines, with different experiences and orthogonal ways of thinking and communicating. 

One way to help create a unified, cohesive community is by bringing everyone together¬†LIVE¬†so we can learn from and inspire each other. As we were emerging from the pandemic in 2022, we started a new tradition we call ‚Äòin vivo week.‚Äô Team members from all over the world come together in person, so we can reaffirm our mission, build connections and learn from outside perspectives.

This year, we were fortunate to host two incredible guests as our keynote speakers. They shed new light on two fundamental takeaways that energized me and the rest of our community of insitrocytes, now close to 300 strong:

First, it's imperative to stay committed to our platform as we build our pipeline. Huge thanks to John Maraganore, the founder of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and the visionary behind RNA interference technology, who described the 20-year journey of building a company that serves as a model for our ‚Äúpipeline through platform‚Äù ethos.¬† Our team was truly inspired by his experiences as he shared how he rode hype cycles, faced challenges, and stayed motivated by following the science and the promise of helping patients. 

Second, time is not on patients' side. Enormous gratitude to the brave Brian Wallach and his wife Sandra Abrevaya, who have lived with Brian‚Äôs #ALS diagnosis for the last six years. To help all ALS patients, they founded I AM ALS, which has helped raise more than $1 billion for new research. They also founded Synapticure to provide care for people living with neurodegenerative conditions and help meet the urgent need for more patient data to drive discovery. Hearing their story, there was not a dry eye in the house.

In vivo week brought us closer than ever and reinforced my conviction and sense of purpose when I first founded insitro. Patients are waiting and we need to continue our journey with courage and urgency, in order to help them."

72,"Generate a LinkedIn post that discusses the misplaced urgency in trying to control AI systems that are much smarter than humans before we've even developed systems smarter than a house cat. The post should critique this distorted view of reality and liken it to trying to control advanced aircrafts in 1925 before foundational technologies were in place. Emphasize that developing intelligence in systems will be a gradual, iterative process, akin to the decades of engineering required to make aviation safe. Stress the importance of approaching AI control from a perspective of making complex tech useful and ensuring that those with domain expertise can steer these technologies effectively, without needing advanced degrees in AI. Highlight the need for a robust control system that bridges the gap between technical and non-technical leaders, ensuring that AI aligns with organizational needs and societal laws. Conclude by arguing that future leadership in AI should focus on control tools to ensure technology serves its intended purpose, rather than requiring a STEM background for effective management.

Include a link to an article about the AI control system question from the perspective of fear and mention the lack of solutions for testing complex systems, which hampers trust in enterprise scale GenAI.","It seems to me that before ""urgently figuring out how to control AI systems much smarter than us"" we need to have the beginning of a hint of a design for a system smarter than a house cat.

Such a misplaced sense of urgency reveals an extremely distorted view of reality.
No wonder the more based members of the organization seeked to marginalize the superalignment group.

It's as if someone had said in 1925 ""we urgently need to figure out how to control aircrafts that can transport hundreds of passengers at near the speed of sound over the oceans.""
It would have been difficult to make long-haul passenger jets safe before the turbojet was invented and before any aircraft had crossed the atlantic non-stop.
Yet, we can now fly halfway around the world on twin-engine jets in complete safety. 
It didn't require some sort of magical recipe for safety.
It took decades of careful engineering and iterative refinements.

The process will be similar for intelligent systems.
It will take years for them to get as smart as cats, and more years to get as smart as humans, let alone smarter (don't confuse the superhuman knowledge accumulation and retrieval abilities of current LLMs with actual intelligence).
It will take years for them to be deployed and fine-tuned for efficiency and safety as they are made smarter and smarter.

https://lnkd.in/eaJ5uuMk Approaching the AI control system question from the perspective of fear is clickbait. Talking about ""smarter than us"" without defining ""smarter"" is clickbait. Machines have better memory than us and can operate at mind-boggling scale. Already. Today.

And technology is getting more complex rapidly.

So how about we approach the question of control from the perspective of how to make complex tech useful and who should be qualified to steer it?

We need systems designed to help steer complex technology (AI and human-made) in a way that is useful, safe, and effective... and doesn't require the people leading and executing projects to have graduate degrees in AI or AI-adjacent fields. 

So when I say control systems, here's what I mean: a way to effectively steer complex things in a world that's getting increasingly complex. The fact that they'd help you with AGI (one day) is a byproduct. There are plenty of other things that need steering and we seem to have collectively forgotten there's no steering wheel.

Shouldn't we be ashamed of building systems that are far reaching in nature (already) without also building the tools that allow them to be shaped and steered by the people most qualified to lead and the domain experts most qualified to understand the nuances of the context we're launching them into? Applied AI leadership shouldn't require a graduate degree in an AI-adjacent field. Surely that's a tipoff that our control tools aren't good enough yet. Surely we should be embarrassed that we haven't annihilated the boundary between the technical and the non-technical yet. We clearly need better tools to form a solid control system. A system that guarantees tech offers what those in charge actually wanted, not what they said they wanted, while also representing the laws and needs of society.

And I don't see a control system that allows a standard senior executive (non-technical, but with domain expertise) to participate well in AI design, development, and testing. To get their perspective on their organization's needs, preferences, priorities, and risk tolerances represented and executed on effectively. Frankly, I don't see many solutions for even testing complex systems, so no wonder all these attempts at ""enterprise scale GenAI without a human in the loop"" keep dying not with a bang but with a whimper. How are we going to trust it with anything important if we can't test it?

I believe the path to leadership in tomorrow's world shouldn't require a STEM background. It should require a leadership background and the right tools for those leaders to build/buy the tech they need and control it so it works as *they* need it to. I call that a control system. And we don't have one yet."

Include specific details about IBM Concert, their open-source model efforts, and AI governance with watsonx. Mention your visit to the Think Conference, share a few standout features, and provide relevant links. End the post with a teaser about vlogging your experience and a hashtag.","Bravo to IBM on everything launched at Think 2024 this week. They‚Äôre getting a lot of things right; let's talk about it üëá

There's so much talk these days about when AI will become smarter than us. But I'm far more interested in what tools we're building that give us control of complex technology. I want control systems that anyone can use - everyone from a machine learning engineer to a business leader or non technical sales person - to steer this technology and maximize their data to make better decisions.

IBM is a proven leader in building these kinds of tools so it was a delight to stop by the Think Conference in Boston this week. It's clear they're laser focused on making it easier for large orgs to integrate GenAI securely and are building ** control systems ** to make it happen. As they told me, their purview is to make AI ""more open, cost effective, and flexible for businesses."" That's what we want!

Here are some of the best things I saw at THINK:

1. IBM Concert: 
- Think of Concert as the nerve center for enterprise automation. Powered by GenAI, Concert looks into all of your applications, predicts potential problems or security issues, and suggests fixes or enhancements.
- What I like about Concert is that it visualizes everything in a way that's easy to understand for technical and non technical folks alike. It shows you a clear view of what models you have and how they're connected. This is a really important step in how we enable more members of enterprise teams to manage really complex technology.
- If you're in security risk management, compliance management, or certificate management take a look at Concert; they're starting with those applications first. You can check out more about Concert here: https://ibm.biz/BdmesT

2. Open source models
- IBM made a big effort to highlight their open-source efforts.
- They released a family of IBM granite models into open source, including their best performing Code LLMs.
- It's great proof that the largest model isn't always best! Granite is a smaller model that scrubs out undesirable content to be hyper performant.
- They're also partnering with Red Hat to launch InstructLab, a model alignment technique for bringing open source community contributions directly into LLMs.

3. AI Governance
- watsonx is IBM's AI and data platform for unifying enterprise data. It helps large organizations scale and govern AI models securely.
- Governance and regulations are becoming far more complicated and changing all the time. watsonx lets you build tech that's compliant, and stays up to date with any regulatory changes.
- I'm really excited to see IBM leading the way on governance so we avoid getting bogged down in compliance and can just keep building.

I did some vlogging on the show floor, so look out for a deeper dive into IBM's new products soon. Until then, you can read more about all of IBM's newest launches here: https://ibm.biz/Bdmesx

Share an anecdote about the debates your team had over details in the Machine Learning Specialization, and stress the values of technical accuracy, utility, clarity, and enjoyment in your content. Mention how you scrutinize learner feedback and take corrective actions when necessary, such as retiring subpar content even if it means forgoing revenue. End with a note that the continuation of your thoughts can be found at a provided link.","As we reach the milestone of the 256th issue of The Batch, I‚Äôm reflecting on how AI has changed over the years and how society continues to change with it. As AI becomes more widely available, it‚Äôs clear that many people ‚Äî developers and non-developers ‚Äî will benefit from high-quality training to keep up with the changes and gain useful AI skills.

In my years of working in education, I‚Äôve felt that the world has enough low-quality courses, newsletters, social media posts, and other forms of content.  It‚Äôs possible to build a business churning out mediocre content in sufficient volume to attract a meaningful amount of attention, but I have no interest in doing that.

At DeepLearning.AI, our core philosophy is to put learners first. Our team obsesses about how to create quality training or other programs that benefit people who want to learn about AI. We have intense debates about what tools to teach, which examples to include, even which partners to work with, based on what we think is best for learners.

For example, I recall vividly how, when working on the Machine Learning Specialization, our team spent ages debating whether to use row or column matrices. Both sides showed up with deep analysis of the pros and cons, made Powerpoint presentations to argue their case, and we spent hours debating over what was better for learners in terms of both ease of picking up the concepts as well as subsequently being able to use these skills with third-party machine learning libraries.

We don‚Äôt release a course unless we think it‚Äôs a good use of a learner‚Äôs time and we‚Äôd be proud to recommend it to our own friends and family members. Quality, of course, can mean a lot of things. I expect what we do to be technically accurate, useful, up to date, clear, and time-efficient for learners. And, if possible, fun!

We don‚Äôt always get it right, but we scrutinize learner feedback (one of my most important weekly routines is to study a dashboard that summarizes learner ratings of our courses) and work to make sure our courses serve learners well. And yes, we have a large-language model powered application that reads learner reviews to flag important issues quickly.

Earlier this year, we realized that some of the paid content we had launched was below our quality standard, and that I wouldn‚Äôt in good conscience recommend it to my friends or family members. Despite this content being profitable, we did what we felt was the right thing for learners. So we decided to retire that content and forgo the revenues, but we feel much better now for having done the right thing for learners.

End with a powerful quote from Sekou Andrews: ""What if AI knows that humanity is the one thing it can enhance ‚Ä¶. but can never inherit.""","Just wrapped up the a360 summit in LA. What an INSPIRING few days. Peter H. Diamandis, I said this before but will say it again: I feel so lucky to be orbiting in your universe! 

I had this aha moment at this summit: We need wholesome AI. What if we didn‚Äôt just build AI that is smarter ‚Ä¶ but instead built wholesome AI. 

When something is wholesome, it is good for our health and well-being. It is good for the environment and our planet. It is trustworthy and morally sound. And it is beautiful in its diversity and inclusivity. Wholesome AI is good for people - all people.  

I spent the last 20 years pioneering #emotionAI and humanizing technology before it dehumanizes. First in Academia at University of Cambridge and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and then later at Affectiva and Smart Eye. 

Marrying AI‚Äôs IQ with EQ is a key ingredient of making #AI wholesome. I loved hearing the theme of Empathy and EQ in AI come up over and over again at the summit. YAY to that! 

But I also has this realization: AI today is not wholesome (yet). In particular, it is lacking diversity in the founders and builders of AI, and as a result, it is lacking in diversity of ideas. I am on a mission to change that. And I am SO grateful that Peter H. Diamandis has publicly committed to the Abundance360 community to continue to give a platform to #women in AI. This year, a360 launched the inaugural women‚Äôs fellow program, which I was part of alongside some amazing women. 

But the summit highlighted that we still have MAJOR work to do. The first 1.5 days of the summit were focused on AI, but only 2 out of 22 speakers on stage were women. The fact is: there simply aren‚Äôt enough women builders, founders and CEOs in AI today. 

Just look at the founders and CEOs of the top AI companies or the most funded AI companies. Being at the summit strengthened my resolve to be a catalyst for change. We absolutely need more women and underrepresented founders building the next generation of AI companies. 

I will leave you with this quote from actor and poet Sekou Andrews ‚ÄúWhat if AI knows that humanity is the one thing it can enhance ‚Ä¶. but can never inherit‚Äù."

Mention how OpenDevin quickly wrote a Python script that generated enjoyable questions for your daughter. Reflect on how coding agents, once a novelty, are becoming genuinely useful despite occasional failures. Explain the typical workflow for a coding agent, including analyzing the problem with an LLM, generating and testing code, and iteratively refining it. Highlight notable papers in the field, such as ‚ÄúAgentCoder: Multiagent-Code Generation with Iterative Testing and Optimisation,‚Äù ‚ÄúLDB: A Large Language Model Debugger via Verifying Runtime Execution Step by Step,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSWE-agent: Agent-Computer Interfaces Enable Automated Software Engineering.‚Äù Discuss the role of multi-agent systems in testing code without user-written test cases and compare output testing and the LDB method in debugging. Mention that agentic workflows often mimic human workflows, making development easier by modeling human problem-solving processes. Include a link to the full text due to LinkedIn's length limit.","On Father‚Äôs Day last weekend, I sat with my daughter to help her practice solving arithmetic problems. To give her practice problems, I used OpenDevin, an open-source agentic coding framework, to write a Python script that generated questions that she enjoyed answering at her own pace. OpenDevin wrote the code much faster than I could have and genuinely improved my and my daughter‚Äôs day. 

Six months ago, coding agents were a novelty. They still frequently fail to deliver, but I find that they‚Äôre now working well enough that they might be genuinely useful to more and more people! 

Given a coding problem that‚Äôs specified in a prompt, the workflow for a coding agent typically goes something like this: Use a large language model (LLM) to analyze the problem and potentially break it into steps to write code for, generate the code, test it, and iteratively use any errors discovered to ask the coding agent to refine its answer. But within this broad framework, a huge design space and numerous innovations are available to experiment with. I‚Äôd like to highlight a few papers that I find notable:
- ‚ÄúAgentCoder: Multiagent-Code Generation with Iterative Testing and Optimisation,‚Äù Huang et al. (2024).¬†
- ‚ÄúLDB: A Large Language Model Debugger via Verifying Runtime Execution Step by Step,‚Äù Zhong et al., (2024).¬†
- ‚ÄúSWE-agent: Agent-Computer Interfaces Enable Automated Software Engineering,‚Äù Yang et al. (2024).

How can we test the code without requiring the user to write test cases? In a multi-agent system, each ‚Äúagent‚Äù is an LLM prompted to play a particular role. An interesting result from AgentCoder shows that having separate agents for writing code and generating tests results in better performance than letting a single agent do both tasks. This is presumably because, if the agent writing the code is also responsible for writing the tests, the tests might be influenced by the code and fail to consider corner cases that the code does not cover.¬†
When people think of testing code, many initially think of output testing, in which we see if the code generates the correct outputs to a specific set of test inputs. If the code fails a test, an LLM can be prompted to reflect on why the code failed and then to try to fix it. In addition to testing the output, the LDB method is helpful. LDB steps through the code and presents to the LLM values of the variables during intermediate steps of execution, to see if the LLM can spot exactly where the error is. This mimics how a human developer might step through the code to see where one of the computational steps went wrong, and so pinpoint and fix the problem. 

A lot of agentic workflows mimic human workflows. Similar to other work in machine learning, if humans can do a task, then trying to mimic humans makes development much easier compared to inventing a new process. [...]

Almost two years of difficult negotiations including over 33 hours in the latest #trilogue. Now, we have a political agreement. 

Our talks have led us to a common European vision: One in which #ArtificialIntelligence is more democratic, safe and competitive.

We succeeded in putting in place guardrails to ensure AI systems are safe and that our democratic values are protected. At the same time, I have pushed hard for - and I believe we have achieved - a reasonable balance between safety and openness to innovation. 

We know that AI is the next big thing when it comes to economic growth and productivity. Europe needs to be on top of it. AI can and will be an engine for European competitiveness. This is why we have tried to provide the conditions for European companies to innovate:  
üëâAmbitious approach to regulatory sandboxes 
üëâFlexible and agile approach to general purpose AI models 
üëâResearch and open source exemptions
üëâOECD definition of AI system 
üëâNarrow scope tailored to only true high-risk use cases 
üëâAlignment with existing sectoral legislation to reduce regulatory burden
üëâImproved measures for SMEs including start-ups
üëâMore realistic and feasible requirements for companies

We must not forget that the #AI Act was put on the table to establish guardrails and regulate risky use cases. We have included the above pro-innovation measures in the text but the EU can still benefit from a more ambitious strategy to fostering AI excellence in Europe.  

Crucial steps lay ahead - including fine-tuning of the text and the adoption of a final deal by both the European Parliament and the Member States. The time after that - once we get there - will be even more crucial to successful implementation through guidelines, standards, etc. 

For the time being, however, this political agreement is a BIG step forward. We have set a common vision for democratic development of AI, one that is in line with our international partners.

Every year since, they spend the week before New Year‚Äôs reflecting on the previous year and setting intentions for the next, often in a warm location. The user finds this tradition valuable and one of their favorite activities, noting it encourages gratitude, creativity, and vulnerability within the family. This year, Adam facilitated the session with innovations like a ""Moonshots & Crazy Ideas"" section and emphasizing systemic implementation and community-focused goals. Outline their 5-step goal-setting exercise:

1. Visualization of December 31, 2024.
2. Specific intentions and goals in various life categories.
3. Moonshot and outrageous ideas.
4. Reflection on highlights, achievements, and lessons of the past year.
5. Choosing a theme word for the year.

End with well wishes for 2024 from the user, Jana Amin.","Ten years ago, I started a tradition with my kids as we were relocating from Cairo to Boston. Jana was 10 and Adam was 4, and I was desperate to make our move fun and meaningful. And so on our long flight over, we pulled out my laptop and worked on our goals for the year. 

Every year since then, we spend the week leading up to New Year‚Äôs sequestered (ideally somewhere warm!) reflecting on the previous year and getting intentional about the next one. And dare I say, it is one of my personal favorite activities of the year. 

Not only is it an opportunity to take stock of all our blessings and to be grateful, but we also get intentional about how and where we want to spend our energy in the coming year. Contrary to popular belief (aka I am not this Monster Mom locking up her kids to goal set LoL), this exercise is SUPER fun. We get quite creative, pushing each other to think big and outside the box. We tease each other but we also get quite vulnerable with each other, sharing our lowlights and hardest lessons we learnt throughout the year. 

This year, Adam took charge as our facilitator and he CRUSHED it. First, to avoid getting stuck in ‚Äúincremental‚Äù goals, we moved our review of this year‚Äôs goals to the end, and added a new Moonshots & Crazy Ideas section. Second, we noticed that you can goal set all you want, but unless you implement systems in place that allow you turn your goal into something actionable, it‚Äôs just a goal (Credit goes to my coach Trevor Timbeck for this one). 

Finally, we noticed that annual goals are often focused on the self. But it‚Äôs way more powerful to think about ‚Äúwhat are you doing for the world‚Äù goals. How are you creating positive impact in your family, school, community and beyond.

So here‚Äôs our 5 step exercise: 

- Visualization: It is the 31st of December 2024. What does your world look like? What have you built? Accomplished? Who are you spending time with? How do you feel? 

- Intentions and Goals: Write down your goals for the year. Be specific. Some categories we like to be intentional about: Health & wellness, spirituality & inner peace, family, love & relationships, professional and academic goals, personal development, financial goals, community & impact goals.

- Moonshot and crazy ideas. Think big. Like what would be outrageous and seemingly impossible to go do. Great!  Now, write those down :) 

- Reflect on the previous year. What were your highlights? What were the biggest achievements? What did you accomplish that weren‚Äôt even on your horizon a year ago (in my case for example, it is the Eisenhower Fellowships) What was the hardest lessons and what did you learn from it? What one thing you did that may impact? How did you fare against your goals from last year? What are you most grateful for? 

- Theme of the year. Capture all of this into one word that encapsulates your energy for the year.

Here‚Äôs to 2024, Happy New Year! Wishing you all an amazing year ahead.

135,"""Generate a LinkedIn post expressing skepticism towards the use of LLMs (Large Language Models) in critical clinical tasks due to their unreliability. The post should reference an enlightening interview with Francois Chollet, who describes LLMs as 'memorization and pattern matching machines,' and their limitations compared to true intelligence, defined as the ability to adapt to an ever-changing world. Mention Piaget's similar definition of intelligence and Chollet's advocacy for hybrid systems combining LLMs with other approaches, like discrete program search, to emulate System 1- and System 2-type thinking as described by Kahneman. Invite real computer scientists to discuss or critique these ideas and point out that LLMs, while useful for drafting under clinical review, should not handle critical medical decisions. Agree with Chollet and Yann LeCun‚Äôs view that the solution is combining LLMs with more rigid, reasoning models to filter the outputs and prevent hallucinations, and cite Nabla's approach inspired by Ian Goodfellow‚Äôs Generative Adversarial Networks.""","Because LLMs are unreliable, I struggle to see how (or why) we will use them for clinical tasks that matter. This fantastic interview helped me see things more clearly. 

Francois Chollet explains that LLMs are memorization and pattern matching machines. While this is quite useful, it is not the same as intelligence, which he defines as ‚Äúthe ability to adapt to an ever-changing world.‚Äù

(Piaget similarly defined intelligence as ‚Äúwhat you use when you don‚Äôt know what to do‚Äù).

Because memorization and pattern matching are limited, Francois argues for hybrid systems that merge LLMs/deep learning with other approaches (e.g., discrete program search) to, in essence, mirror what Kahneman described as System 1- and System 2-type thinking.

I'll let the real computer scientists elaborate or tell me why this is wrong. 

To me, the point is that if we ever broadly use LLMs for clinical tasks where errors matter, they will likely be combined with other types of AI. (Other leading computer scientists like Stephen Wolfram also argue for this). Spencer Dorn you are actually right. As Yann LeCun says, LLMs are ""just"" enormous autocomplete engines. When they are used to draft something, with systematic clinician review, that's OK. But we shouldn't use them for medical decisions when even 99.9% accuracy is not enough.

I agree with Fran√ßois Chollet that the solution is to combine LLMs (we should be careful with anthropomorphism but I like to think of them as the creative, subconscious part of the brain) with more rigid models (that would be the prefrontal cortex) that reason and ""filter"" the output of the LLM. Yann LeCun also suggests this approach.

At Nabla we are actually using such an approach to prevent hallucinations. It's inspired from Ian Goodfellow‚Äôs Generative Adversarial Networks, where two very different models compete against each other."

Provide recommendations to learn more, referencing specific papers: ""Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models,"" ""HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in Hugging Face,"" and ""Understanding the planning of LLM agents: A survey.""","‚Äã‚ÄãPlanning is a key agentic AI design pattern in which we use a large language model (LLM) to autonomously decide on what sequence of steps to execute to accomplish a larger task. For example, if we ask an agent to do online research on a given topic, we might use an LLM to break down the objective into smaller subtasks, such as researching specific subtopics, synthesizing findings, and compiling a report.

Many people had a ‚ÄúChatGPT moment‚Äù shortly after ChatGPT was released, when they were surprised that it significantly exceeded their expectation of what AI can do. If you have not yet had a similar ‚ÄúAI Agentic moment,‚Äù I hope you will soon! I had one several months ago, when I presented a live demo of a research agent I had implemented that had access to various online search tools.

I had tested this agent multiple times privately, during which it consistently used a web search tool to gather information and wrote up a summary. During the live demo, the web search API unexpectedly returned with a rate limiting error. I thought my demo was about to fail publicly. To my surprise, the agent pivoted deftly to a Wikipedia search tool ‚Äî which I had forgotten I‚Äôd given it ‚Äî and completed the task using Wikipedia instead of web search.

This was an AI Agentic moment of surprise for me. It‚Äôs a beautiful thing when you see an agent autonomously do things in ways that you had not anticipated, and succeed as a result!

Many tasks can‚Äôt be done in a single step. For example, to simplify an example from the HuggingGPT paper (cited below), if you want an agent to examine a boy's picture and draw a picture of a girl in the same pose, the task might be decomposed into two steps: (i) detect the boy's pose and (ii) render a picture of a girl in the detected pose. An LLM might be fine-tuned or prompted (with few-shot prompting) to specify a plan by outputting a string like ""{tool: pose-detection, input: image.jpg, output: temp1 } {tool: pose-to-image, input: temp1, output: final.jpg}"".

This structured output triggers software to invoke a pose detection tool followed by a pose-to-image tool to complete the task. (This example is for illustrative purposes only; HuggingGPT uses a different format.)

Admittedly, many agentic workflows do not need planning. For example, you might have an agent reflect on, and improve, its output a fixed number of times,  resulting in a set of fixed, deterministic steps. But for complex tasks in which you can't specify a task decomposition ahead of time, Planning allows the agent to decide dynamically what steps to take.

The California SB1047 bill will kill open source models in California. But legislators don't realize this because they've been told the carve outs in the bill are sufficient. Apparently the research community hasn't communicated how easy it is to change the behavior of a #LLM with small amounts of training. 

Jeremy Howard wrote an excellent piece on this here: https://lnkd.in/gisHcJ_A. The important parts are these:

* California‚Äôs SB 1047 bill requires, under penalty of perjury, the developers assure their ‚Äúmodel has does not have a hazardous capability‚Äù, even if up to 25% of the weights are changed
* Senator Scott Wiener, the primary backer of the bill, says that they crafted the bill ‚Äúin a way that ensures that open source developers are able to comply‚Äù.

and ""It is not possible to provide assurance that a released model can‚Äôt be used to cause harm, because a released model can be changed.""

The best way to regulate AI is like this:

""We can still regulate AI, and allow open source. To do so, we can regulate use of AI, rather than development of AI. If someone uses AI for election interference, or discriminatory resume screening, or deep fakes, for instance, that usage can be made illegal.""

Especially when a lesser-included addiction of said junkie is, ""How did this happen?‚Äù (Just try to guess what I'm referring to. You're all correct.) 

My need to understand how people make their decisions is one reason why, 30 years ago, I went into journalism; why, four years ago, I left a life as a lawyer and why, newly MBA'd, I picked the AI business because of its throughline in my career and its role in my own decision making as a leader. 

Scroll to the end for the punchline of how my hiatus year ends.¬† Stay for the story: 

After having served as Chief of Staff to DataRobot's COO-turned-CEO, I took a break exactly one year ago. I didn‚Äôt have a plan and didn‚Äôt yet want one. 

A Chief of Staff to a CEO must stay on top of the current events, so I was already well informed. But newly free to dig deeper, I've found myself more deeply immersed in current events and trends unfolding in the U.S. and around the world. From the safety of my own home, my Zoom password forgotten and my suitcase mostly unused, I‚Äôve had lots of time to reflect, contextualize, and think about the future.

Oh, and also I turned 50.

A few takeaways from this chair in which I now sit:

- People have forgotten that AI was invented in America and that we need to lead on it.
- Cooperation, collaboration, and transparency always win.¬†
- AI is our greatest opportunity for rapid prototyping and solutioning for every single one of our most pressing problems.¬†
- Women are great leaders.

I've watched the AI industry change by the day, in broad and deep ways. It's a challenging world out there for all players. 

So, given all I know, what could possibly pull me away from this most awful hobby and plunge me back into the AI froth, you ask? 

Two things: No.1, the massive and growing collection of stories every day about AI improving someone's life, from finding a wounded soldier to predicting extreme weather to helping a quadriplegic person move a cursor. And Gen AI is upskilling people everywhere. There is hope to be had. 

No. 2, the LinkedIn message last month from a former colleague teasing the opportunity to work with the pioneer in the field of Decision Science herself, Google‚Äôs first Chief Decision Scientist, a voice that helped shape my thinking on getting value from AI and who‚Äôs been unstoppable since she broke out on her own last year.

AND SO, IT IS THEREFORE with shock and gratitude and a real sense of fate and fortuitousness that I hereby announce my next role as Chief of Staff to Cassie Kozyrkov, who today as CEO of her company Data Scientific helps executives and leaders all over the world make better decisions. 

I‚Äôm back! #AI It is with great pleasure that I welcome Karin Jenson as my Chief of Staff. Here's to a phenomenal partnership!"

* Persistence is key. If you have conviction, don‚Äôt take no for an answer. 

* Prioritize self-care. Leaders underestimate how contagious their energy is on their teams. It took me a lot of years to prioritize self-care and in doing so, positively affect those around me.

Diamandis. 

There‚Äôs never been a better time to start a company as AI evolves from powerful language models to ""large action models"" that can translate ideas into reality. 

But it doesn‚Äôt stop there. #AI will revolutionize science and biology, including drug discovery and therapeutics. Today, it takes on average 17 years for a scientific discovery to make its way to physicians. Well, AI can hugely reduce this timeline as it can ingest scientific discoveries in a matter of minutes. I am also excited for the application of AI in the discovery of new material, chemistry and physics. 

At the summit, I loved hosting a session with Natalie Monbiot on the emerging virtual human economy. We showed examples of people putting their AI self to work to earn passive income. For instance, your AI self could teach online lectures, and do so in a language you don‚Äôt even speak in real life! 

Celebrities are at the forefront of this, licensing their voice to video games. Of course, while these¬†cloning¬†technologies can be empowering, they also present risks: how do you retain control over your virtual identity? How can we detect misuse, and how can we protect against it?¬†In short: How do we make¬†AI¬†cloning¬†work for us and not against us? #claimyourclone 

I‚Äôm also extremely proud of my son Adam, who rocked facilitating the teen program this year, bringing youth voices into the mix. I even got to hang out at their table! We explored ways these young people are using AI in their daily lives, and how they plan to use AI to achieve their goals. 

We also had the opportunity to visit Machani Robots. As adults, we often get trapped in the uncanny valley of these robots. But kids? They engage so comfortably with these social robots. We even got Ria to sing ‚ÄúShake it off‚Äù by Taylor Swift. 

But the biggest takeaway I brought home from Abundance 360: be BOLD. Be relentless in pursuit of your dreams. Jason Ballard, the founder of ICON, left me speechless with his vision of tackling poverty with 3D-printed houses ‚Äì beautiful, affordable, and built in record time. Then there was Dean Kamen, the inventor behind the Segway and the first insulin pump for diabetics. He brought the entire room to tears with his mission to unite kids from across the globe in an annual robotics competition.

This revolution we're in... is it an #AI revolution? #UX revolution? Both?

I like this attached Garry Tan tweet a lot. 

To explain why, let's take a quick tour of recent AI hype cycles:

AI buzz is, of course, not new! Two decades ago, hype was high. But most of the chatter involved aspirational methodology ‚Äî theory that hadn‚Äôt been put into practice yet ‚Äî because two components were still missing: huge datasets and the computer hardware to process them.

In ~2016, AI was also everywhere. But it was hidden in plain sight as a subtle, unobtrusive component in software applications. Netflix didn't want you thinking about its underlying AI. They wanted to serve you the most accurate recommendations possible tp keep you watching longer.

Now... today. ChatGPT launched November '22 and suddenly the user was encouraged to interact directly with an AI component. We moved from an era of AI delivering seamless correctness, to an era in which AI is designed for usefulness.

Behind the scenes, UX designers are permitting themselves to serve you an unprecedented user interaction: an AI system that‚Äôs allowed to serve garbage‚Ä¶ as long as it‚Äôs useful garbage.

What kicked off the UX shift? Public tools for generating AI art. Since art is in the eye of the beholder, that conversation was already more about usefulness rather than correctness (""Is that a hand with 7 fingers looool‚Äù but also ‚Äúmaybe if I rerun the prompt a few dozen times, it'll be cool enough to use in my blog post."")

Then ChatGPT leveled things up by offering the same incorrect-but-useful experience to the nontechnical public in what has been the most popular user interaction for decades: text-in-text-out. The result is a massive reset in user expectations about what ‚Äúquality‚Äù means for AI output. Remember, GPT (the core tech) models were available several years before ChatGPT (the interface that let non-programmers interact with the core tech easily). The change came from allowing users to interact. In doing so, it altered user expectations. 

So what does this mean going forward?

For better or worse, many decisions related to AI are shifting from the AI builders to the users themselves. Great UX will be essential; tools must be easy, elegant, and intuitive to attract more users.

But UX is not just about ease of use. It's about how much control we have. It's about building a steering wheel so we AI users can better control the rapidly-evolving technology that the AI builders are shipping. I write more about building control systems here: https://lnkd.in/e-9iPWxY

Are you thinking about AI UX? Or AI control? I'd love to hear your thoughts - how do you see it evolving? And what do you want to see next?

195,"Write a LinkedIn post describing four design patterns for AI agentic workflows that can drive significant progress. These patterns should include Reflection, Tool use, Planning, and Multi-agent collaboration. Emphasize that instead of having an LLM generate its final output directly, an agentic workflow prompts the LLM multiple times to build step by step to higher-quality output. Focus particularly on Reflection, explaining that it is quick to implement and can lead to surprising performance gains. Illustrate this by describing a scenario where an LLM writes code, reflects on its own output, receives constructive criticism, and rewrites the code to improve it. Highlight the benefits of automating the step of delivering critical feedback for producing better responses. Mention the usefulness of tools like unit tests or web searches for evaluating output, and discuss the potential of using a multi-agent framework for further improvement. Conclude with references to three publications about reflection: ""Self-Refine: Iterative Refinement with Self-Feedback"" by Madaan et al. (2023), ""Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning"" by Shinn et al. (2023), and ""CRITIC: Large Language Models Can Self-Correct with Tool-Interactive Critiquing"" by Gou et al. (2024).","Last week, I described four design patterns for AI agentic workflows that I believe will drive significant progress: Reflection, Tool use, Planning and Multi-agent collaboration. Instead of having an LLM generate its final output directly, an agentic workflow prompts the LLM multiple times, giving it opportunities to build step by step to higher-quality output. Here, I'd like to discuss Reflection. It's relatively quick to implement, and I've seen it lead to surprising performance gains. 

You may have had the experience of prompting ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini, receiving unsatisfactory output, delivering critical feedback to help the LLM improve its response, and then getting a better response. What if you automate the step of delivering critical feedback, so the model automatically criticizes its own output and improves its response? This is the crux of Reflection. 

Take the task of asking an LLM to write code. We can prompt it to generate the desired code directly to carry out some task X. Then, we can prompt it to reflect on its own output, perhaps as follows:

Here‚Äôs code intended for task X:
[previously generated code]
Check the code carefully for correctness, style, and efficiency, and give constructive criticism for how to improve it.

Sometimes this causes the LLM to spot problems and come up with constructive suggestions. Next, we can prompt the LLM with context including (i) the previously generated code and (ii) the constructive feedback, and ask it to use the feedback to rewrite the code. This can lead to a better response. Repeating the criticism/rewrite process might yield further improvements. This self-reflection process allows the LLM to spot gaps and improve its output on a variety of tasks including producing code, writing text, and answering questions.

And we can go beyond self-reflection by giving the LLM tools that help evaluate its output; for example, running its code through a few unit tests to check whether it generates correct results on test cases or searching the web to double-check text output. Then it can reflect on any errors it found and come up with ideas for improvement.

Further, we can implement Reflection using a multi-agent framework. I've found it convenient to create two agents, one prompted to generate good outputs and the other prompted to give constructive criticism of the first agent's output. The resulting discussion between the two agents leads to improved responses.

Reflection is a relatively basic type of agentic workflow, but I've been delighted by how much it improved my applications‚Äô results. If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about reflection, I recommend:
- Self-Refine: Iterative Refinement with Self-Feedback, by Madaan et al. (2023)

Then, highlight recent achievements in open-sourcing similar software at your current company and express excitement about the possibilities it unlocks for the wider community. Conclude with personal thoughts on the importance of open-sourcing and how it aligns with your current role.","One of my biggest learnings from my career at Microsoft was that we should have open-sourced more of the work that my team did there. We had an internal C++ library called VisionTools that was a building block for lots of great products: Photosynth, Windows Photo Gallery, and Kinect to name a few. The library currently sits barely used now in some internal repository. I'm convinced that it could have instead powered many more projects out in the open world. But that was a different time and luckily the industry now has many more open-source proponents.

So, I'm thrilled that Ocean, the core image-processing and CV C++ library that we use at Meta, is now open-source. This library was specifically engineered to meet the requirements of building apps on mobile devices. It has a small binary footprint, is optimized for mobile processors, and has some nice examples to get started quickly with things like processing a live camera feed. Ocean is used across all of Meta's apps (Facebook, IG, Messenger, WhatsApp) as well as the Quest VR headsets. I'm excited to see what people build with it! Yes, nothing more frustrating than seeing an awesome piece of software you contributed to sitting on a digital shelf, gathering digital dust, ignored, because your employers doesn't believe in open source.

203,"Please write a LinkedIn post discussing the inclusive nature of the machine learning field. Highlight how the field has accepted various algorithms, even those developed long before the invention of computers, unlike the initial reaction from statistics departments to machine learning developments. Use this contrast to lead into a discussion about ""agentic systems"" and how we should view systems as being ""agent-like"" to varying degrees instead of debating their classification as true agents. Emphasize the importance of fostering a welcoming environment for everyone interested in working on agentic systems and the substantive value the term ‚Äúagentic‚Äù has in technical discussions as opposed to marketing jargon. Finally, encourage a collaborative and inclusive approach in building increasingly sophisticated agentic workflows.","One reason for machine learning‚Äôs success is that our field welcomes a wide range of work. I can‚Äôt think of even one example where someone developed what they called a machine learning algorithm and senior members of our community criticized it saying, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not machine learning!‚Äù Indeed, linear regression using a least-squares cost function was used by mathematicians Legendre and Gauss in the early 1800s ‚Äî long before the invention of computers ‚Äî yet machine learning has embraced these algorithms, and we routinely call them ‚Äúmachine learning‚Äù in introductory courses!

In contrast, about 20 years ago, I saw statistics departments at a number of universities look at developments in machine learning and say, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not really statistics.‚Äù This is one reason why machine learning grew much more in computer science than statistics departments. (Fortunately, since then, most statistics departments have become much more open to machine learning.)

This contrast came to mind a few months ago, as I thought about how to talk about agentic systems that use design patterns such as reflection, tool use, planning, and multi-agent collaboration t0 produce better results than zero-shot prompting. I had been involved in conversations about whether certain systems should count as ‚Äúagents.‚Äù Rather than having to choose whether or not something is an agent in a binary way, I thought, it would be more useful to think of systems as being agent-like to different degrees. Unlike the noun ‚Äúagent,‚Äù the adjective ‚Äúagentic‚Äù allows us to contemplate such systems and include all of them in this growing movement.

More and more people are building systems that prompt a large language model multiple times using agent-like design patterns. But there‚Äôs a gray zone between what clearly is not an agent (prompting a model once) and what clearly is (say, an autonomous agent that, given high-level instructions, plans, uses tools, and carries out multiple, iterative steps of processing).

Rather than arguing over which work to include or exclude as being a true agent, we can acknowledge that there are different degrees to which systems can be agentic. Then we can more easily include everyone who wants to work on agentic systems. We can also encourage newcomers to start by building simple agentic workflows and iteratively make their systems more sophisticated.

In the past few weeks, I‚Äôve noticed that, while technical people and non-technical people alike sometimes use the word ‚Äúagent,‚Äù mainly only technical people use the word ‚Äúagentic‚Äù (for now!). So when I see an article that talks about ‚Äúagentic‚Äù workflows, I‚Äôm more likely to read it, since it‚Äôs less likely to be marketing fluff and more likely to have been written by someone who understands the technology.

Let‚Äôs keep working on agentic systems and keep welcoming anyone who wants to join our field!

204,"Generate a LinkedIn post about the emergence of multi-agent collaboration as a key AI agentic design pattern. The post should explain how complex tasks, like writing software, are broken down into subtasks to be executed by different roles (e.g., software engineer, product manager, designer, quality assurance engineer). Each role is represented by different agents built by prompting a Large Language Model (LLM). Highlight why using multiple agents is effective, such as improved performance demonstrated by ablation studies and better handling of long, complex inputs. Discuss how this approach mirrors real-world team management and the benefits of an agentic workflow. Mention the role of multi-agent frameworks like AutoGen, Crew AI, and LangGraph, and encourage readers to experiment with ChatDev, a virtual software company implementation. Conclude with recommendations for further reading on the topic, citing relevant papers (e.g., Communicative Agents for Software Development, AutoGen, MetaGPT). Include a link to the original text if necessary.","Multi-agent collaboration has emerged as a key AI agentic design pattern. Given a complex task like writing software, a multi-agent approach would break down the task into subtasks to be executed by different roles -- such as a software engineer, product manager, designer, quality assurance engineer, and so on -- and have different agents accomplish different subtasks.

Different agents might be built by prompting a LLM to carry out different tasks. For example, to build a software engineer agent, we might prompt: ""You are an expert in writing clear, efficient code. Write code to perform the task ‚Ä¶"". 

It might seem counterintuitive that, although we are making multiple calls to the same LLM, we apply the programming abstraction of using multiple agents. I'd like to offer a few reasons:
- It works! Many teams are getting good results with this method, and there's nothing like results! Ablation studies (for example, in the AutoGen paper cited below) show that multiple agents give superior performance to a single agent.¬†
- Even though some LLMs today can accept very long input contexts, their ability to truly understand long, complex inputs is mixed. An¬†agentic workflow in which the LLM is prompted to focus on one thing at a time can give better performance. 
- It gives us a framework for breaking down complex tasks. When writing code to run on a single CPU, we often break our program up into different processes or threads. This lets us decompose a task -- like implementing a web browser -- into subtasks that are easier to code. Multi-agents roles is, similarly, a useful abstraction.

In companies, managers decide what roles to hire and then how to split complex projects into smaller tasks to assign to employees with different specialties. Using multiple agents is analogous. Each agent implements its own workflow, has its own memory (itself a rapidly evolving area in agentic technologies -- how can an agent remember enough of its past interactions to perform better on upcoming ones?), and may ask other agents for help. Agents themselves can also engage in Planning and Tool Use. While managing people is hard, it's a sufficiently familiar idea that it gives us a mental framework for how to ""hire"" and assign tasks to our AI agents. 

Frameworks like AutoGen, Crew AI, and LangGraph provide rich ways to build multi-agent solutions. If you're interested in playing with a fun multi-agent system, check out ChatDev, an open source implementation of a set of agents that run a virtual software company. While it may not always produce what you want, you might be amazed at how well it does!

I believe AI climate modeling has an important role to play. 

Here's the situation as I see it:
- Earth is on track to a catastrophic 2-4 degrees Celsius of warming. The article references the UN Environment Program's estimate of 2.9 degrees on the current trajectory.
- We have a high degree of confidence that geoengineering via stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) will significantly lower Earth's average surface temperature. The science here is really solid: Use aerosols in the atmosphere to reflect more sunlight away from earth, and we become cooler.
- So, why don't we just do it? Multiple reasons, but the biggest is that we still don't have good models for estimating how it will affect local climate and weather patterns, even though we're confident global average surface temperature will go down. 

That's why better AI climate modeling is crucial for reducing uncertainty and better understanding the impacts of various geoengineering strategies.

There're other issues to consider too, like governance, moral hazard (disincentivizing decarbonization), equity,  pollution from the aerosols, and the challenging implementation engineering. But many of these  problems become easier if we can make progress on the core problem of better understanding what impact SAI will have."

Human sensing AI is one of the investment themes of Blue Tulip Ventures. At Affectiva, I spent 20 years doing external sensing of human signals, now I‚Äôm turning that inward!

For the past couple of months I‚Äôve been experimenting with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). I use Dexcom 7 and the Levels app and have found the data to be fascinating. The app tracks the immediate effect foods (and activity) has on your glucose level, which is super cool. 

7 things I learnt from wearing a continuous glucose monitor: 

1- Mindful eating works: when I‚Äôm intentional about my food, starting every meal with veggies and fiber ü•¶ü•¨ü•ë, then proteins üêü and then optionally end with a some fruit or choc (if I am craving that), my glucose doesn‚Äôt spike at all. Thank you GlucoseGoddess for that tip. 

2- Take that walk after your meals: A 30-45 minute walk after dinner really helps level my glucose level (Thank you Sophie V. Vandebroek for that tip!) 

3- Watch your snack! The way I snack is the opposite of mindful eating üò´üôà. I basically sit on my laptop and munch away! And it turns out that a spike from a handful or grapes or raspberries is equal to that of eating 3-4 squares of dark chocolate üç´üôà!!!! (Haven‚Äôt tested what yummy Egyptian mangos will do ü•≠) Any tips on what‚Äôs a great snack? 

4- What‚Äôs in your vitamins? My vitamin gummies apparently have enough sugar to spike my glucose üòî.  I am trying to transition to pills, but I must admit I haven‚Äôt been as consistent.  

5- Travel totally messes me up üò´ often, I will carry nuts and chocolate .. see my June 5th data with spikes everywhere !üôàü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôàü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôàü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôà .. I need to figure out how to travel w olives or something healthy like that :) airport food isn‚Äôt helpful either. Any suggestions ? 

6- Better form factor! I have to say the current sensors on the market are so unsexy and many people assumed there‚Äôs something wrong with me! I wish the sensor were more compact and discrete. I imagine that will happen as CGMs become more mainstream (in the same way that fitness and sleep trackers like WHOOP or ≈åURA ring have become ubiquitous).

7- Multimodal please! How cool would it be if my CGM integrated with my whoop and other sensors like NiX. Imagine if we each had a personalized #AI health companion. This is the future and I know of at least one startup that is working on that .. 

So have you used a CGM? If yes, what have you learnt? What are some #human sensing startups that are worth looking into?"

217,"Generate a LinkedIn post that explains the concept and significance of tool use in AI agentic workflows, particularly in the context of LLMs (Large Language Models). Discuss how tool use goes beyond simple tasks like web search and code execution, and highlight its expanded capabilities. Mention how developers are using functions to perform various tasks, the role of large multimodal models (LMMs), and the evolution of tool use in LLMs. Include references to recent works and articles for further reading on the topic. End with a nod to the previous post about Reflection as a complementary design pattern.","Tool use, in which an LLM is given functions it can request to call for gathering information, taking action, or manipulating data, is a key design pattern of AI agentic workflows. You may be familiar with LLM-based systems that can perform web search or execute code; some large consumer-facing LLMs already incorporate these features. But tool use goes well beyond this. 

If you prompt an online LLM-based chat system, ‚ÄúWhat is the best coffee maker according to reviewers?‚Äù, it might decide to use web search to gain context. Early on, LLM developers realized that relying only on a transformer to generate output tokens is limiting, and that giving an LLM a web search tool lets it do much more. With such a tool, an LLM is either fine-tuned or prompted (perhaps with few-shot prompting) to generate a special string like {tool: web-search, query: ""coffee maker reviews""} to request calling a search engine. (The exact format of the string depends on the implementation.) A post-processing step then looks for strings like these, calls the web search function with the relevant parameters when it finds one, and passes the result back to the LLM as additional input context.

Similarly, if you ask, ‚ÄúIf I invest $100 at compound 7% interest for 12 years, what do I have at the end?‚Äù, the LLM might use a Python execution tool to compute 100 * (1+0.07)**12. The LLM might generate a string like this: {tool: python-interpreter, code: ""100 * (1+0.07)**12""}.

But tool use now goes much further. Developers are using functions to perform search (web, Wikipedia, arXiv, etc.), interface with productivity tools (email, calendar, etc.), generate or interpret images, and more. We can prompt an LLM using context that gives detailed descriptions of many functions plus information about their arguments. And we‚Äôd expect the LLM to automatically choose the right function to call to do a job.

Before widespread availability of large multimodal models (LMMs) like LLaVa, GPT-4V, and Gemini, LLMs could not process images directly, so a lot of early work on tool use was carried out by the computer vision community. At that time, the only way for an LLM-based system to manipulate images was by calling a function to, say, carry out object recognition or some other function. Since then, tool use has exploded. GPT-4‚Äôs function calling, released last year, was a significant step toward general-purpose tool use. Now, more and more LLMs are being developed to similarly be facile with tool use.

To learn more, I recommend:
- Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with Massive APIs, Patil et al. (2023)
- MM-REACT: Prompting ChatGPT for Multimodal Reasoning and Action, Yang et al. (2023)
- Efficient Tool Use with Chain-of-Abstraction Reasoning, Gao et al. (2024)

Both Tool Use and Reflection, which I posted about last week, are design patterns that I can get to work fairly reliably, and are well worth learning about.

Highlight that the legislation mistakenly targets AI technology rather than AI applications, failing to effectively enhance AI safety. Emphasize that alternative safety measures, such as banning nonconsensual deepfake pornography and standardizing content identification, would be more beneficial. Discuss how SB 1047's complex reporting requirements and vague language create uncertainty for developers, especially concerning certification of compliance under penalty of perjury. Explain that the law's demands on developers to predict and mitigate potential AI harms and misuse are unreasonable, given the current uncertainty among leading AI researchers. End by providing a link to the latest draft of the law for readers to review.","I continue to be alarmed at the progress of proposed California regulation SB 1047 and the attack it represents on open source and more broadly on AI innovation. As I wrote previously, this proposed law makes a fundamental mistake of regulating AI technology instead of AI applications, and thus would fail to make AI meaningfully safer. I‚Äôd like to explain why the specific mechanisms of SB 1047 are so pernicious to open source.

To be clear, there are routes that regulators should pursue to improve safety. For example, I would welcome outlawing nonconsensual deepfake pornography, standardizing watermarking and fingerprinting to identify generated content, and investing more in red teaming and other safety research. Unfortunately, the proposed bill pursues a less beneficial and more harmful path.

SB 1047‚Äôs purported goal is to ensure safety of AI models. It puts in place complex reporting requirements for developers who fine-tune models or develop models that cost more than $100 million to train. It is a vague, ambiguous law that imposes significant penalties for violations, creating a huge gray zone in which developers can‚Äôt be sure how to avoid breaking the law. This will paralyze many teams.

You can read the latest draft of the law online. I‚Äôve read through it carefully, and I find it ambiguous and very hard to follow.

Developers who try to navigate the law‚Äôs complex requirements face what feels like a huge personal risk. It requires that developers submit, under penalty of perjury, a certification of compliance with the requirements of the law. But when the requirements are complex, hard to understand, and can even shift according to the whims of an unelected body (more on this below), how do we ensure we are in compliance?

For example, the certification must include many different sections. One is an analysis of ‚Äúthe nature and magnitude of critical harms ‚Ä¶ the model might reasonably cause or enable.‚Äù But given that even leading AI researchers aren‚Äôt sure what harms models might cause or enable, how is a team of developers supposed to figure this out and declare ‚Äî under penalty of perjury ‚Äî that they meet this requirement?

Further, some developers will be required to implement ‚Äúprotections to prevent ‚Ä¶ misuse of, or unsafe post-training modifications of, the covered model and all covered model derivatives ‚Ä¶ that are appropriate in light of the risks associated with the covered model, including from advanced persistent threats or other sophisticated actors.‚Äù Even leading AI researchers don‚Äôt agree on how best to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù AI models against these supposed risks, or what would be ‚Äúappropriate.‚Äù So how are developers supposed to figure out how to comply with this requirement?

236,"Write a LinkedIn post discussing the following points in detail:

1. Mention the increasing demand for more compute and data to train large foundation models. Highlight that the need for compute is equally pressing for inference on these models.

2. Draw on your experience leading teams at Google, Baidu, and Stanford that focused on scaling up deep learning. Share how semiconductor makers, data center operators, and researchers frequently asked you if AI would continue to benefit from more compute, akin to the diminishing returns seen with CPU performance for desktop workloads.

3. Describe your consistent response, encouraging them to keep scaling up, noting that machine learning engineers generally never feel they have enough compute.

4. State that this prediction has been accurate so far and that further benefits from faster and higher volumes of inference are still untapped.

5. Explain why faster token generation is crucial, especially for agentic workflows involving repeated prompts, tool usage, planning and executing multiple steps, and collaboration between multiple agents. Mention that fast token generation can help avoid the bottleneck in leveraging existing models more effectively.

6. Reference companies like Groq and SambaNova, which have achieved fast token generation rates, thus addressing this need.

7. Discuss the advantages of faster, cheaper token generation in making the evaluation of models more feasible and less costly.

8. Mention ongoing conversations with Cathie Wood and Charles Roberts of ARK investment firm and their predictions about the rapid decline in AI training and inference costs. Use specific figures for falling costs.

9. Conclude with optimism about the rapid decrease in training and inference costs due to advancements in semiconductors and algorithms, and its positive impact on application builders and AI agentic workflows.

Include a link to the original source as a reference.","Much has been said about many companies‚Äô desire for more compute (and data) to train large foundation models. I think it‚Äôs under-appreciated that we also have nowhere near enough compute available for inference on foundation models.

Years ago, when I was leading teams at Google, Baidu, and Stanford that focused on scaling up deep learning, many semiconductor makers, data center operators, and researchers asked me if AI would continue to make good use of more compute if they kept delivering it. For many desktop workloads, like running a web browser, a faster CPU doesn‚Äôt help much beyond a certain point. So do we really need faster and faster AI processors? Each time, I confidently replied ‚Äúyes!‚Äù and encouraged them to keep scaling up compute. (Sometimes, I added half-jokingly that I had never met a machine learning engineer who felt like they had enough compute. üòÄ)

Fortunately, this prediction has been right so far. However, beyond training, we are also far from exhausting the benefits of faster and higher volumes of inference.

Today, a lot of LLM output is for human consumption. A human might read around 250 words per minute, which is around 6 tokens per second (250 words/min / (0.75 words/token) / (60 secs/min)). So it might seem there‚Äôs little value to generating tokens much faster than this.

But in an agentic workflow, an LLM might be prompted repeatedly to reflect on and improve its output, use tools, plan and execute multiple steps, or implement multiple agents that collaborate. So, we might generate hundreds of thousands of tokens or more before showing any output to a user. This makes fast token generation very desirable and makes slower generation a bottleneck to taking better advantage of existing models.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm excited about the work of companies like Groq, which can generate hundreds of tokens per second. Recently, SambaNova¬†also showed it can hit hundreds of tokens per second.

Incidentally, faster, cheaper token generation will also help make running evaluations (evals), which can be slow and expensive today since it involves iterating over many examples, more palatable. 

Fortunately, both training and inference are rapidly becoming cheaper. I spoke with Cathie Wood and Charles Roberts of the investment firm ARK, which is famous for its bullish predictions on tech. They estimate that AI training costs are falling 75% a year. If they are right, a foundation model that costs $100M to train this year might cost $25M to train next year. Further, they report that for ‚Äúenterprise scale use cases, inference costs seem to be falling at an annual rate of ~86%, even faster than training costs.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know how accurate these specific predictions will turn out to be, but with progress in both semiconductors and algorithms, I do see training and inference costs falling rapidly. This will be good for application builders and help AI agentic workflows lift off!

How can you preserve model accuracy as you compress from 32 bits to 16, 8, or even 2 bits? In our new short course, Quantization in Depth, taught by Hugging Face's Marc Sun and Younes Belkada, you'll learn to implement variants of linear quantization, such as asymmetric and symmetric modes, from scratch. You'll also quantize at different granularities (per-tensor, per-channel, per-group) to maintain performance. You‚Äôll then construct a quantizer to compress any open source deep learning model‚Äôs dense layers to 8-bit precision. Finally, you‚Äôll practice quantizing weights into 2 bits by packing four 2-bit weights into a single 8-bit integer.

1. A brief comparison of AI's impact on junior vs. top performers based on three study findings: 
   - Junior customer support agents were 35% faster than usual, while top performers saw little improvement.
   - The bottom half of BCG consultants had a 43% quality boost with ChatGPT-4, versus 17% for top performers.
   - A law school study found the lowest-skilled participants saw the largest improvements.
2. Mention how AI tools like Midjourney allow even amateurs to perform decently in creative tasks, acknowledging the contribution of the original artists whose work was used for training.
3. Include an alternative UX-based perspective from Ethan Mollick, suggesting that current AI systems may not yet be sufficient to aid top performers.
4. Discuss the difference between individual productivity and marginal enterprise productivity, noting potential pitfalls such as faster submission of unvetted or misdirected code.
5. Conclude with an open-ended question inviting thoughts from the readers on the relationship between AI, skill levels, and performance.","The Great Equalizer: Does AI level the playing field?

A recent newsletter I read argued that AI pulls bottom performers closer to the top, citing 3 studies:
Out of 5,000 customer support agents, junior workers were 35% faster than usual, but top performers saw little improvement.¬†
The bottom half of BCG consultants saw a 43% boost in work quality using ChatGPT-4, compared to just 17% for the top performers.
A law school study discovered that ‚Äúthe lowest-skilled participants saw the largest improvements‚Äù in performance.

And, of course, yours truly can appear to be a half-decent illustrator thanks to Midjourney and the artists whose work was used to train it.

An alternative UX-based take:
‚ÄúJust because early results for AI suggest that only lower performing people benefit does not mean that this is the only possible pattern. It may be that the reason only lower performers gain from AI currently is because the current AI systems are not good enough to help top performers.‚Äù --Ethan Mollick

If AI is the great equalizer, why would it make bad programmers worse at their jobs? What gives?

Because these studies are looking at marginal individual productivity rather than marginal enterprise productivity. Yes, it's possible to write code faster but it's also possible to submit code that's not fully vetted faster... and it's also possible to submit code that solves the wrong problem faster (and to also to write code that creates problems you didn't have before). So before you get caught up in the excitement of individual productivity boosters, do remember that these effects aren't taking the broader context into account. Most GenAI tools are still built with individual UX in mind and not organization-wide design, so do remember to take a pause if you're tempted to draw general conclusions about the relationship between skill/IQ and performance.

What are your thoughts?"

With over 500,000 tokens per second in Llama 70B throughput, Sohu lets you build products impossible on GPUs.

Sohu is the world‚Äôs first specialized chip (ASIC) for transformers (the ‚ÄúT‚Äù in ChatGPT). By burning the transformer architecture into our chip, we can‚Äôt run most traditional AI models. But for generative AI models, like ChatGPT (text), SD3 (images), and Sora (video), Sohu has unparalleled performance.

One Sohu server runs over 500,000 Llama 70B tokens per second: >20x more than an H100 server (23,000 tokens/sec), and >10x more than a B200 server.

We recently raised $120M from Primary Venture Partners and Positive Sum, with participation from Two Sigma Ventures, Skybox Datacenters, Hummingbird Ventures, Oceans, Fundomo, Velvet Sea Ventures, Fontinalis Partners, Galaxy, Earthshot Ventures, Max Ventures and Lightscape Partners.

We‚Äôre grateful for the support of industry leaders, including Peter Thiel, David Siegel, Thomas Dohmke, Jason Warner, Amjad Masad, Kyle Vogt, Stanley Freeman Druckenmiller, and many more.

We‚Äôre on track for one of the fastest chip launches in history:
- Top hardware engineers and AI researchers have left every major AI chip project to join us.
- We‚Äôve partnered directly with TSMC on their 4nm process. We‚Äôve secured HBM and server supply from top vendors and can quickly ramp our first year of production.
- Our early customers have reserved tens of millions of dollars of our hardware.

(Benchmarks are from running in FP8 without sparsity at 8x model parallelism with 2048 input/128 output lengths. 8xH100s figures are from TensorRT-LLM 0.10.08 (latest version), and 8xB200 figures are estimated. This is the same benchmark NVIDIA and AMD use.) The AI chip landscape, currently dominated by NVIDIA is SO ripe for disruption. Congratulations Etched on your $120M Series A round. I am so proud to be an investor. 

Training AI models today cost billions of dollars (not to mention that training these models consumes the power equivalent of what a country like Costa Rica consumes in a whole year!). At the current pace, our hardware, our power grids, and pocketbooks can‚Äôt keep up. 

Etched is changing this. In 2022, they made a bet that transformers (the ‚ÄúT‚Äù in ChatGPT) would take over the world. The team made that bet even before OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public - how cool! Today, every state-of-the-art AI model is a transformer: ChatGPT, Sora, Gemini, Stable Diffusion 3, and more. 

The team Etched spent the past two years building Sohu, the world‚Äôs first specialized chip (ASIC) for transformers. Sohu is an order of magnitude faster and cheaper than NVIDIA‚Äôs next generation of Blackwell (GB200) GPUs when running text, image, and video transformers.

Etched is making one the biggest bets in #AI right now and they are on track for one of the fastest chip launches in history. If they pull this off, every AI product will run on their chips. Excited to be on this journey with the team.

Include acknowledgments for those who assisted you.","I think AI agentic machine translation has huge potential for improving over traditional neural machine translation, and am releasing as open-source a demonstration I'd been playing with as a fun weekend project.

Using an agentic workflow, this demonstration (i) Prompts an LLM to translate from one language to another, (ii) Reflects on the translation to come up with constructive suggestions, (iii) Uses the suggestions to refine the translation. In our limited testing, this is sometimes competitive with, and sometimes worse than, leading commercial providers.

But it gives a highly steerable translation system where by simply changing the prompt, you can specify the tone (formal/informal), regional variation (do you want Spanish as spoken in Spain or as spoken in Latin America?), and ensure consistent translation of terms (by providing a glossary).

This is not mature software. But I hope the open-source community can make agentic translation work much better. Given how a simple reflection workflow already gives decent results, I think there's significant headroom to make agentic translation much better.

Releasing an early software prototype like this is something new I decided to try to see if it is helpful to the developer community. I'd love any feedback on this.

267,"Write a LinkedIn post that discusses the viral story of an MIT-trained neurosurgeon who quit his job at 38 to move to the woods. Mention that you, too, are taking a break to ensure you maintain a balanced and cheerful version of yourself while building a business. Reflect on the two typical reactions people have to the neurosurgeon's decision: either alarm at his quitting without a plan or applause for his bravery. Emphasize the importance of exploring more than just two options in life choices. Encourage people to avoid reaching a breaking point before making significant life changes and instead recommend regular self-check-ins and setting up decent options before making major pivots. Explain that it's better to make periodic small adjustments (""always be quitting a little bit"") to ensure long-term happiness and fulfillment. End by noting that more insights will be shared in a blog post linked below, without the intention of inspiring immediate quitting from bad situations.","There's a viral video going around from an MIT-trained neurosurgeon who quit his job at 38 to move to the woods. 

Since I‚Äôm heading into the woods myself today to take a small break from the breakneck pace of building a business and make sure the version of me I share with the world is balanced and cheerful, I thought I‚Äôd make a little incision into this neurosurgeon‚Äôs decision to finally quit.

Everyone in his life, of course, told him to stay. Look at the facts, they said: ""You have 15 years of training, extraordinary pay, life-saving skills, and the prestige of being a brain surgeon. You have no other skills, your wife isn't working, and you have no plan to make money. You cannot quit.‚Äù

Most people would expect me to pick a side, either expressing alarm at his quitting his job without a plan or applauding him for being brave enough to quit (with full support from his wife) a job in which he felt sad, frustrated, angry, and stuck. The trouble is that I‚Äôd be teaching a poor lesson either way, since I‚Äôd be encouraging you to buy into the idea that there are only ever two options on the table. 

In reality, there are always many more possibilities than we realize. We don‚Äôt have to get to a breaking point before we pivot and start steering our lives in the direction we‚Äôd like to go in.

Don‚Äôt let things get so bad that you take the decision to quit out of your own hands. If you don‚Äôt like your job, the way to quit isn‚Äôt to wait until burnout. That reminds me of using a wall as a means of stopping your car. Don‚Äôt do that‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd recommend using the brakes and the steering wheel to go where you need to.
I‚Äôll link the video in the blog post below, but not as inspiration to quit a bad situation immediately.

I‚Äôve made major pivots many times in my life, but I‚Äôve never done it without setting up some decent options first. To do this, I‚Äôve made sure never to let things get to a place where they‚Äôre truly on fire. Yes, if you single-mindedly pursue a goal without checking in with yourself about what makes you happy and if you let things get as bad as this fellow did (and I do believe him when he says they‚Äôre as bad for him as they are) then quitting the way he did is the right move.

But that's not the best approach. I'm convinced that one key to a great life is regular check-ins with yourself. In fact, I'd say you should always be quitting (just a little bit). Before you react, let me explain what I mean here:"

(3) Importance of AI security today
(4) A metaphor comparing AI security to baby car seats from the 1950s
(5) Encouraging the adoption of safety-oriented design in AI

Link to the blog post: https://lnkd.in/eVq6TDw4","(Don't) Ask Astro? You might want to know what security pests this little a16z chatbot is harboring before you use it. Let's talk about the state of AI security!

Background: Ask Astro is an astronomy chatbot modeled on reference LLM app architecture from Andreessen Horowitz (that hallowed VC firm whose name you're likely to have seen abbrev. a16z), so you'd think it would be secure, right? After all, it's a fairly straightforward example of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application.

Because it comes from a16z, this architecture is an influential guide that many developers reference in the hopes of building scalable and robust AI solutions within the tech industry... and unfortunately it's crawling with badness.

A team at cybersecurity firm Trail of Bits, led by my friend Dan Guido, did a comprehensive security audit of Ask Astro and discovered several substantial ""hybrid ML security"" issues in it that blur the line between machine learning and systems security. These include split-view data poisoning, prompt injection, and GraphQL injection... these are all ways that attackers can manipulate the chatbot‚Äôs responses by exploiting weaknesses in how data is handled.

Glossary:
üêû Split-view data poisoning¬†occurs when an attacker changes online data after it's been indexed by the system, leading to discrepancies between what's stored and what's currently true.
üêû Prompt injection¬†involves inserting misleading cues to make the AI generate specific, often incorrect, outputs.
üêû GraphQL injection¬†exposes the chatbot to potential data breaches by allowing attackers to craft malicious queries that manipulate the database interactions, potentially leaking or corrupting data.

Here's a link to the blog post, which you should definitely share with whoever on your team is responsible for AI security: 

https://lnkd.in/eVq6TDw4

(Not kidding, this is useful to them. The security audit also provides best practices that can benefit anyone developing similar technologies. Go on, send it, I'll wait. Also, if you're using AI at work and *no one* is responsible for AI security, well, uh-oh. Share this with whoever's in charge, then.)

Now, for the rest of us, what does it mean?

People seem to be taking for granted that AI security is in a better place than  it actually is. We're complacent. See that picture of the baby car seat from the 1950s? AI today looks to AI security experts like that baby car seat looks to you. What could possibly go wrong?

No one is saying that we should all stop driving, but pretty please take the idea of seat belts and safety-oriented design seriously. Same goes for AI. But right now we're all driving without seatbelts.

Drop your questions in the comments, since the folks from Trail of Bits will be watching this space today to answer anything you want to know about AI security.

They recently founded Answer.ai, an R&D lab aiming to the Bell Labs for AI. In this episode, they share insights into the evolving landscape of AI agents, the practical applications of their research, and their unique approach.¬†Some highlights from our conversation: 

Too Many Splashy Demos

Eric draws a parallel between the development of electricity and the current state of AI to emphasize the necessity for practical applications over ‚Äúsplashy demos‚Äù. He points out that, like early electrical innovations, the potential uses of AI are clear but transitioning from experimental prototypes to reliable, widely deployed technology requires extensive and often painstaking development. Eric criticizes the focus on flashy AI demos that lack substantive progress toward real-world usability and deployment. He advocates for an Edison-like focus on resolving practical issues, improving the ergonomics, deployability, and cost-efficiency of AI technologies to truly transform them into usable products. This approach, he argues, is crucial for AI to move beyond the lab and into everyday applications.

Jeremy‚Äôs Concern with the latest California AI legislation 

Jeremy highlighted concerns about a proposed Californian law (SB 1047) intended to ensure AI safety. Despite its good intentions, he argues that the part of the law that attempts to ensure the safety of AI models could unintentionally decrease safety by restricting access to AI models. He explains that AI models, like neutral tools such as pens or the internet, can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes. This fundamental characteristic makes it impossible to guarantee a model's safety completely, as its use and outcomes depend significantly on how it is applied by end-users.

Jeremy stressed that even with rigorous testing, a model that appears safe in controlled conditions might be repurposed to do harm, similar to how innocuous technology can be adapted for negative uses. He argued that the proposed law could lead to restrictive practices that prevent the widespread beneficial use of AI, creating an environment where AI technology is hoarded by a few large players, reducing transparency and stifling innovation in fields where AI could have profoundly positive impacts.

When Agents Make Sense 

Agents excel in tasks that involve recombining elements seen in their training data, such as managing emails, adding CSS to HTML, or debugging Python code. However, they struggle with tasks requiring novel planning or algorithm creation not represented in the training data.

Like most things in life, the best approach in enterprise is to start not with the technology, but with the business problem you‚Äôre trying to solve.

But it should be what you try after traditional programming fails.* When you have something to automate, but you aren‚Äôt able to do it with your existing bag of tricks. When the need is so critical that you‚Äôre willing to add complexity and the reduction of control that comes with it.

*This doesn't mean traditional programming has to have failed on your watch.

Beutel and Nicholas Lane.

Federated learning allows a single model to be trained across multiple devices, such as phones, or multiple organizations, such as hospitals, without the need to share data to a central server.

This two-part course gives you an introduction to federated learning, and then teaches you how to fine-tune your large language model with distributed data using Flower Lab‚Äôs open source federated learning framework.

You‚Äôll learn:
- How to use federated learning to train a variety of models, ranging from speech and vision models to LLMs, across distributed data while offering data privacy options to users and organizations.
- Privacy Enhancing Technologies like differential privacy (DP), which obscures individual data by adding calibrated noise to query results.
- Two variants of differential privacy - Central and Local - and how to choose depending on your use case.
- How to measure and decrease bandwidth usage to make federated learning more practical and efficient with techniques like using pre-trained models and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
- How federated LLM fine-tuning reduces the risk of leaking training data.

A NeurIPS Outstanding Paper award recipient, Are Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models a Mirage? (by Rylan Schaeffer,¬†Brando Miranda and¬†Sanmi Koyejo) studies emergent properties of LLMs, and concludes: 
""... emergent abilities appear due the researcher‚Äôs choice of metric rather than due to fundamental changes in model behavior with scale. Specifically, nonlinear or discontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or continuous metrics produce smooth, continuous, predictable changes in model performance."" 

Public perception goes through discontinuities when lots of people suddenly become aware of a technology -- maybe one that's been developing for a long time --  leading to a surprise. But growth in AI capabilities is more continuous than one might think.

And what a conversation that was! 

ChatGPT launched on Nov. 30, 2022, disrupting industries, internet search and, according to some, human intelligence itself. A year later, the success of ChatGPT has spawned numerous, well-funded rivals (even the French are in this race :)), and a fierce debate between techno-optimists and so-called ""doomers"". 

Of course I had to start by asking Reid about the recent drama at OpenAI! Reid was on OpenAI‚Äôs board until last March when he stepped down to avoid conflict of interest with his other investments. I was particularly intrigued by Reid‚Äôs POV that OpenAI‚Äôs governance structure - a not-for-profit that oversees a commercial org - is perfectly feasible and there‚Äôs precedent for it (e.g., Mozilla) ‚Ä¶ as long as there‚Äôs alignment of values and direction. 

We also reflected on some of the positive and perhaps surprising use-cases of ChatGPT over the past year: how Gen Z‚Äôs use ChatGPT and GenAI to explore special interests, synthesize information and for creative self-expression.

Reid dreams big: every person will have access to a personal AI assistant. Inflection.ai, the company he co-founded with Mustafa Suleyman is building Pi (Personal Intelligence), a kind and empathetic AI bot that can be a friend, coach, thought partner and helps you be the best version of yourself. LOVE THAT! 

AI has the potential to elevate humanity! But of course, there are risks. We discussed the role of regulation including Biden‚Äôs Executive Order and the EU AI act. One area of concern is how AI hallucinations and deep fakes will lead to misinformation in the upcoming election cycle in the US. 

Building on my conversation with Reid, I then moderated a discussion on how ‚ÄúChatbots are the Talk on AI Innovation‚Äù with Eugenia Kuyda, Founder & CEO at Replika, Stefanos Loukakos, CEO at Connectly.ai and Vipul Vyas, Senior Vice President at Persado.

With the help of companies like Connectly and Persado, retailers are using conversational bots to personalize sales outreach and interactions, leveraging emotional messages to evoke action. Replika is on a mission to combat loneliness. But do chatbots that offer friendship and intimacy help us feel less lonely or ‚Ä¶ more lonely? 

Finally, with Google‚Äôs Gemini recent launch, the future will bring multi-model AI bots that interact through text, voice and video. 

Ps. Reid's impromptu book is a must-read: https://lnkd.in/eqWWK6ru

üåÄ MedPerf is nuanced to revolve around the concept of a human committee, which is accountable for the medical AI task and coordinates benchmark stakeholders (e.g., patients, clinicians, those who have the data for the AI to use, researchers who write the AI models, etc.).

üåÄ MedPerf benchmarks are designed to be agnostic of the input data type - radiology studies, structured EHR data, pathology whole-slide images, genomics files, surgery videos, multi-modal input, you name it.

There are probably many answers to that, but the right answer today is üîé FRAUD üîç.

Fraudsters are creating more sophisticated phishing scams by using GenAI to create fake voices, images, videos and paper trails. But the good guys are starting to wield AI as well, particularly LLMs... which can be very helpful for:

- Analyzing transaction data to spot anomalous patterns such as unusually large transfers or frequent small transactions.
- Detecting phishing attempts and fraudulent communication by analyzing the language and structure of emails.
- Understanding typical customer behavior and flagging deviations that indicate account takeover or fraud attempts.
- Evaluating the authenticity of documents like invoices, receipts, and contracts by comparing them against known legitimate documents.

Your Dharma is your essence or inner calling. We all feel best when there is alignment of that essence and what we do - we feel confident, creative, and caring, with a sense of purpose that shines through our life and work. The good news is Dharma is not something you have to go out and find - it's already inside you, but has been buried under layers of expectations, judgments, and the realities of daily life. Everyday Dharma offers practical exercises that help you uncover your dharma. I went all out and created a fun mind map exploring my dharma :) 

My essence is to spark joy thru human connection and possibility. If you know me, you will know that I love meeting new people, hearing their stories, inspiring, opening doors and imagineering possibility.

313,"Generate a LinkedIn post that addresses the current discourse around AI control systems. The post should emphasize that approaching the AI control question from a perspective of fear or using terms like ""smarter than us"" without clear definitions is unproductive and akin to clickbait. Highlight the capabilities of machines in terms of memory and scalability, noting the rapid complexity in technology development. The focus should shift to how we can make complex technologies useful and determine who should be qualified to steer these advancements.

Stress the need for systems designed to manage complex technology in a way that is useful, safe, and effective, without requiring project leaders to have advanced degrees in AI or related fields. Define control systems as methods to effectively guide complex technologies in our increasingly intricate world. Emphasize the embarrassment and necessity of having tools allowing systems to be shaped and steered by domain experts and leaders without technical degrees.

Point out the lack of existing control systems that enable senior executives to participate in AI design, development, and testing effectively. Address the importance of representing organizational needs, preferences, priorities, and risk tolerances in AI projects. Explain why current attempts at enterprise-scale AI without human oversight often fail due to inadequate testing solutions.

Conclude by advocating for a future where leadership in technology does not require a STEM background, but rather a leadership background supported by appropriate tools to control and steer tech developments effectively. Highlight the absence of a proper control system and the need to develop one.","Approaching the AI control system question from the perspective of fear is clickbait. Talking about ""smarter than us"" without defining ""smarter"" is clickbait. Machines have better memory than us and can operate at mind-boggling scale. Already. Today.

And technology is getting more complex rapidly.

So how about we approach the question of control from the perspective of how to make complex tech useful and who should be qualified to steer it?

We need systems designed to help steer complex technology (AI and human-made) in a way that is useful, safe, and effective... and doesn't require the people leading and executing projects to have graduate degrees in AI or AI-adjacent fields. 

So when I say control systems, here's what I mean: a way to effectively steer complex things in a world that's getting increasingly complex. The fact that they'd help you with AGI (one day) is a byproduct. There are plenty of other things that need steering and we seem to have collectively forgotten there's no steering wheel.

Shouldn't we be ashamed of building systems that are far reaching in nature (already) without also building the tools that allow them to be shaped and steered by the people most qualified to lead and the domain experts most qualified to understand the nuances of the context we're launching them into? Applied AI leadership shouldn't require a graduate degree in an AI-adjacent field. Surely that's a tipoff that our control tools aren't good enough yet. Surely we should be embarrassed that we haven't annihilated the boundary between the technical and the non-technical yet. We clearly need better tools to form a solid control system. A system that guarantees tech offers what those in charge actually wanted, not what they said they wanted, while also representing the laws and needs of society.

And I don't see a control system that allows a standard senior executive (non-technical, but with domain expertise) to participate well in AI design, development, and testing. To get their perspective on their organization's needs, preferences, priorities, and risk tolerances represented and executed on effectively. Frankly, I don't see many solutions for even testing complex systems, so no wonder all these attempts at ""enterprise scale GenAI without a human in the loop"" keep dying not with a bang but with a whimper. How are we going to trust it with anything important if we can't test it?

I believe the path to leadership in tomorrow's world shouldn't require a STEM background. It should require a leadership background and the right tools for those leaders to build/buy the tech they need and control it so it works as *they* need it to. I call that a control system. And we don't have one yet."

Developing new drugs is an expensive, time-consuming, and failure-prone process, with only a small percentage of potential drug candidates making it from discovery through clinical testing to regulatory approval.

Some AI-assisted approaches to antibiotic discovery have built on protein folding prediction.  Other work has created deep learning models directly for the underlying problem, to predict which drugs will have antibacterial activity.

There is something special about early stage startups - the passion and conviction is contagious. I love supporting founders turning their ideas into reality and want to keep doing more of that :) 

I am an entrepreneur at heart and have been thinking about starting my own venture firm for a while. And who better to partner with on this than Gabi! Gabi and I have worked together for 10 years at Affectiva. 

We had an amazing collaboration and are thought partners, so much so that we often complete each other‚Äôs sentences haha. 

We are very aligned on what we want to build:

‚Ä¢ We believe AI will be transformative and will offer massive economic opportunity, but it has to be done right. 

‚Ä¢ We believe AI needs to be in service of humanity, supporting us to be healthier, happier, more productive and connected ‚Ä¶ enhancing what it means to be human in the age of AI.  

‚Ä¢ We believe AI can help protect our planet, through food innovation and sustainable living, address the impact of climate change and power scientific discovery.

‚Ä¢ We believe AI needs to be developed and used ethically, ensuring it does not cause harm to humans or the planet, and that it is transparent and safe with proper governance.

‚Ä¢ We have conviction that the answer is human-centric AI. AI that puts people and the planet we live on first. We want to invest in and build diverse teams and ideas, as we fundamentally believe that diversity fosters innovation and mitigates bias and injustice.

So why the Blue Tulip?

Achieving almost unicorn status, the extraordinary blue tulip is rare and elusive in nature. Its beauty signifies creativity and uniqueness. Gifting a blue tulip expresses that the recipient is unique. At Blue Tulip Ventures, we invest in hard-to-find early-stage startups that build human-centric #AI, and we celebrate them with the blue tulip because they are unlike anyone else and inspire us.

We know we have so many supporters among you who will join us on this journey. 

Stay tuned, more to come.

Which is why it's important to ask yourself: do you actually need AI to solve your problem?

AI excels when the task is too complex for traditional programming. For example, teaching a computer to generate impressive video footage -- anyone else playing with the latest drop from Runway? -- would be nearly impossible to do by writing out explicit¬†instructions. So we feed the computer examples (data!) and let it learn that way instead.

But for many problems - even large problems, even enterprise-scale problems - we'll get more reliable, accurate results by expressing our wishes to the machines in the¬†most precise way possible. So how do you select the right approach?

349,"Generate a LinkedIn post that motivates newcomers in the field of AI to start with coursework for systematic learning and then engage in small, weekend projects. Highlight the value of both structured learning and creative tinkering using an anecdote involving children building Lego structures. Emphasize the benefits of building unique projects to hone key skills, and share a personal example of a recent AI project that did not result in a deliverable but was a valuable learning experience. Encourage readers to pursue their project ideas and find peers to discuss and celebrate their work.","A good way to get started in AI is to start with coursework, which gives a systematic way to gain knowledge, and then to work on projects. For many who hear this advice, ‚Äúprojects‚Äù may evoke a significant undertaking that delivers value to users. But I encourage you to set a lower bar and relish small, weekend tinkering projects that let you learn, even if they don‚Äôt result in a meaningful deliverable. 

Recently, my son and daughter (ages 3 and 5) were building Lego vehicles. They built a beautiful ice-cream truck as well as a . . . umm . . . colorful and asymmetric dinosaur car, shown in the picture. While most observers would judge the ice-cream truck as the superior creation, my kids built it by following Lego‚Äôs instructions, and it is likely identical to thousands of ice-cream trucks built by others. In contrast, building the dinosaur car required creativity and novel thinking. The exercise helped them hone their ability to pick and assemble Lego building blocks.

There is, of course, room for both mimicking others‚Äô designs (with permission) and coming up with your own. As a parent, I try to celebrate both. (To be honest, I celebrated the dinosaur car more.) When learning to build Lego, it‚Äôs helpful to start by following a template. But eventually, building your own unique projects enriches your skills. 

As a developer, too, I try to celebrate unique creations. Yes, it is nice to have beautiful software, and the impact of the output does matter. But good software is often written by people who spend many hours tinkering and building things. By building unique projects, you master key software building blocks. Then, using those blocks, you can go on to build bigger projects.

I routinely tinker with building AI applications, and a lot of my tinkering doesn‚Äôt result in anything useful. My latest example: I built a Streamlit app that would authenticate to Google docs, read the text in a doc, use a large language model to edit my text, and write the result back into the doc. I didn‚Äôt find it useful in the end because of friction in the user interface, and I‚Äôm sure a commercial provider will soon, if they haven‚Äôt already, build a better product than I was able to throw together in a couple of hours on a weekend. But such tinkering helps me hone my intuition and master software components (I now know how to programmatically interface with Google docs) that might be useful in future projects.¬† 

If you have an idea for a project, I encourage you to build it! Often, working on a project will also help you decide what additional skills to learn, perhaps through coursework. To sustain momentum, it helps to find friends with whom to talk about ideas and celebrate projects ‚Äî large or small.

You can of course buy the book in lots of other places too. Here's the official MIT Press page, with links to various bookstores.
https://lnkd.in/eNMb54h8

As for the answer to the question you have been asking, ""What is AGI?"": I do not know. I wrote a book about AGI, and have been an AI researcher for 20 years, and I don't know what AGI is. And I'd bet you don't know either. There's a gaggle of AGI definitions out there, mostly incompatible, and all of them flawed in some way.

But it doesn't matter. The concept of AGI is not important and does not need to be defined. ""Intelligence"" and ""general"" are also fuzzy concepts. It would probably be better for everyone if we stopped talking about AGI and talked about specific technical capacities instead. But we can't stop, can we? Thinking and talking about AGI is just so attractive, so fun.

That's why you should read my book about AGI."

MedARC is a novel, open, & collaborative approach to medical AI research.

It was created to develop large-scale AI models for medicine & build interdisciplinary teams to address clinical needs.

The progress of AI in other fields has had huge leaps enabled by the training & utilization of large-scale AI foundation models (ex: ChatGPT, StableDiffusion). To enable advances in medical AI, we believe it's necessary to develop foundation models specific to medicine.

Inspired by initiatives like EleutherAI, LAION, CarperAI, OpenBioML, we will do so by establishing an open and collaborative research community with access to computational resources.

While we're interested in development of foundation models for medicine, we aren't limiting ourselves!

Successful medical AI research require interdisciplinary teams of clinicians with a good understanding of medical problems as well as machine learning (ML) research. We believe establishing this collaborative and decentralized community/organization will serve as a great opportunity to bring together these disparate groups of experts & build such interdisciplinary teams to address a variety of clinical needs with AI/ML solutions.

An important principle of MedARC is doing science in the open. Models and datasets will be open sourced whenever possible, in accordance with any privacy and legal concerns. We aim to publish all our results as preprints and in reputed peer-reviewed journals/conferences.

We have established a public environment with asynchronous communication (a Discord server) that allows others to discuss and follow research progress and contribute. We already have two ongoing projects (fMRI image reconstruction, and Stable Diffusion for Chest X-rays)!

MedARC is led by Tanishq Abraham (founding CEO) and Jeremy Howard (President). Both come with significant expertise in medical AI and open-source research. 

Stability AI serves as our main partner and we are grateful for all of their support. We have also partnered with Stanford Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging (AIMI) and other institutions.

This was my first time doing a retreat like this, so it was a bit outside my comfort zone, BUT it felt so empowering to own one‚Äôs health. Here are 5 health hacks: 

- Food as medicine: We ate clean - tons of colorful vegetables, olive oil, proteins and very little sugar (not even chocolate üò´. 14 hour overnight fast. 

- Restorative sleepüò¥, exercise üí™üèΩ: We ate dinner early and prioritized sleep, then started the day with a walk or hike, then exercise. 

- Hormesis via cold and head exposure: We did sauna followed by cold plunge -  I made it to 4 minutes and 45 seconds ü•∂. I also tried cryotherapy, where you‚Äôre in a chamber for 3 mins in a temperature of ‚Äì 85 ¬∞C (-150¬∞F). 

- Most of us lead busy, stressful lives, so I LOVED that we mindfulness work, e.g. breathwork (that was my first and was sooo powerful!), sound healing and a cocoa ceremony. 

- I tried some new things e.g. red light therapy, hyperbaric oxygen, ozone therapy ++
- We did all this together and in community, which is one of the most important factors in longevity. 

Today, functional medicine isn‚Äôt accessible to everyone. But imagine if we each had an AI co-pilot for our health. This is what Mark‚Äôs new company Function Health is building. I found my wheels turning all week. We are at the cusp of a healthspan revolution with the ubiquity of sensors, data and AI ‚Ä¶ democratizing access to wellness. 

But perhaps the most powerful part of this experience: 

My fingers and toes tend to get super cold (my son Adam too!). I always thought that‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm an Egyptian living in Boston ü§£! I mentioned this to Mark on one of our hikes and he immediately flagged this as ‚ÄúReynaud‚Äôs disease‚Äù, which is an autoimmune disease and could be caused by a number of things including a leaky gut. I had NO IDEA anything was wrong with me. But my blood tests confirmed the leaky gut and now I have a game plan on how to address it. 

This year I set an intention to prioritize my health and wellness, so this retreat was a gift üôè. Like Mark says, every now and then we need to reset our bodies to the factory settings!

6. Conclusion on how this understanding can help professionals benefit from LLMs despite their limitations.
7. Call to action with a link to a relevant service or product.","Selon Yann Le Cun, ChatGPT n'est pas intelligent parce qu'il n'a pas ces 4 caract√©ristiques du cerveau humain. Et c'est essentiel de les conna√Ætre pour une seule raison.

Le Cun dirige le d√©partement IA chez Meta et c'est l'un des chercheurs en intelligence artificielle les plus r√©put√©s.

Contrairement √† certains loubards de l'IA qui le critiquent alors qu'ils ont 1% de sa connaissance, on √©coute et on analyse les paroles d'un ponte comme Yann Le Cun.

Lorsqu'il dit que ChatGPT n'est pas intelligent, il parle globalement des LLMs.

1) Capacit√© √† comprendre le monde physique

Sur ce point, difficile de contester sa parole.

Les LLMs n'ont pas de ""capteurs"" pour interagir avec l'environnement comme nous le faisons.

Ils analysent des textes, mais ne per√ßoivent pas le monde autour d'eux.

Tout le contraire de nous et d'autres mod√®les d'IA d'ailleurs, comme les capteurs de l'autopilot d'une Tesla.

2) Capacit√© de m√©morisation

L√†, on commence √† discuter !

En fait, il y a une confusion entre m√©moire et fen√™tre contextuelle.

Comme le dit tr√®s bien Le Cun, l'IA g√©n√©rative n'a pas de m√©moire et elle oublie m√™me ses donn√©es d'apprentissage.

Elle ne fait que les ""r√©gurgiter"" apr√®s un prompt de notre part en faisant un calcul de probabilit√©.

Cela peut s'apparenter √† de la m√©moire, mais ce n'est pas le cas.

La fen√™tre contextuelle, c'est la capacit√© √† m√©moriser des √©l√©ments dans un contexte pr√©cis, comme un chat.

Sauf que l√†, on a des fen√™tres contextuelles th√©oriques, pouvant aller jusqu'√† 1 million de tokens (750 000 mots) sur Gemini !

Mais tout √ßa est th√©orique et on a d√©j√† tous observ√© des ""pertes de m√©moire"" bien avant la limite th√©orique.

Bref, les LLM peuvent se rappeler des informations dans une conversation en cours, mais oublient rapidement ce qui a √©t√© dit pr√©c√©demment.

Et donc √ßa signifie qu'il faut bien structurer les interactions (= prompter) avec l'IA pour qu'elle soit efficace, en fournissant les informations n√©cessaires au bon moment.

3) Capacit√© de raisonnement

Le Cun d√©mystifie ce point √©galement.

Les LLM suivent des patterns et des probabilit√©s fond√©es sur des donn√©es d'entra√Ænement.

S'ils n'ont pas la capacit√© de raisonnement humain, leur objectif est de l'imiter et, quand un LLM nous r√©pond, il mime le raisonnement humain.

Mais √ßa n'en est pas et c'est en partie pour √ßa qu'on voit des hallucinations.

4) Capacit√© de planifier

Pour ce point, √ßa para√Æt √©vident.

Les LLMs sont incapables de pr√©voir des choses √† long terme et ont besoin de nous pour les guider.
-----
Une fois qu'on sait tout √ßa, on sait exactement comment tirer b√©n√©fice des LLMs pour notre activit√©, parce qu'on conna√Æt leurs limites principales.

Et m√™me avec ces limites, √ßa reste des outils pouvant nous assister de mani√®re exceptionnelle, notamment dans les TPE/PME.

It was a reminder of how deeply intertwined #technology is with every aspect of our lives. From airlines to hospitals, businesses of all sizes now rely on digital infrastructure to function. 

This incident is not just an inconvenience; it exposed the vulnerabilities of over-reliance on a few tech giants. When a major platform stumbles, the ripple effects are felt across industries and continents.

The post should outline the limitations of current standardized evaluation tools for large language models (LLMs) ‚Äî such as MMLU, HumanEval, the LMSYS Chatbot arena, and large-scale benchmarking like HELM ‚Äî emphasizing issues like dataset leakage and the subjective nature of human evaluations. Contrast these with the more limited options available for specific LLM applications, differentiating between unambiguous, right-or-wrong responses and more complex free-text outputs. Highlight the difficulties in automating evaluations for free-text responses, despite advances in using language models for scoring. Conclude by mentioning how this problem has been a topic of ongoing discussion and note Andrew Ng's recent involvement. Make sure the post aligns with LinkedIn's length limit, and include a reference link to the rest of the text.","A barrier to faster progress in generative AI is evaluations (evals), particularly of custom AI  applications that generate free-form text. Let‚Äôs say you have a multi-agent research system that includes a researcher agent and a writer agent. Would adding a fact-checking agent improve the results? If we can‚Äôt efficiently evaluate the impact of such changes, it‚Äôs hard to know which changes to keep.

For evaluating general-purpose foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) ‚Äî which are trained to respond to a large variety of prompts ‚Äî we have standardized tests like MMLU (multiple-choice questions) and HumanEval (testing code generation); the LMSYS Chatbot arena, which pits two LLMs‚Äô responses against each other and asks a human to judge which response is superior; and large-scale benchmarking like HELM. These evaluation tools are invaluable for giving LLM users a sense of different models' relative performance. Nonetheless, they have limitations: For example, leakage of benchmarks datasets‚Äô questions and answers into training data is a constant worry, and human preference for certain answers does not mean those answers are more accurate.

In contrast, our current options for evaluating specific applications built using LLMs are far more limited. Here, I see two major types of applications.
- For applications designed to deliver unambiguous, right-or-wrong responses, we have reasonable options. Let‚Äôs say we want an LLM to read a resume and extract the candidate's most recent job title, or read a customer email and route it to the right department. We can create a test set that comprises ground-truth labeled examples with the right responses, and measure the percentage of times the LLM generates the right output. The main bottleneck is creating the labeled test set, which is expensive but surmountable.
- But many LLM-based applications generate free-text output with no single right response. For example, if we ask an LLM to summarize customer emails, there‚Äôs a multitude of possible good (and bad) responses. The same holds for a system to do web research and write an article about a topic, or a RAG system for answering questions. It‚Äôs impractical to hire an army of human experts to read the LLM‚Äôs outputs every time we tweak the algorithm and evaluate if the answers have improved ‚Äî we need an automated way to test the outputs. Thus, many teams use an advanced language model to evaluate outputs. In the customer email summarization example, we might design an evaluation rubric (scoring criteria) for what makes a good summary. Given an email summary generated by our system, we might prompt an advanced LLM to read it and score it according to our rubric. I‚Äôve found that the results of such a procedure, while better than nothing, can also be noisy ‚Äî sometimes too noisy to reliably tell me if the way I‚Äôve tweaked an algorithm is good or bad.

I believe we‚Äôre all better off if anyone can carry out basic AI research and share their innovations. Right now, I‚Äôm deeply concerned about California's proposed law SB-1047. There are many things wrong with this bill, but I‚Äôd like to focus here on just one: It defines an unreasonable ‚Äúhazardous capability‚Äù designation that may make builders of large AI models liable if someone uses their models to do something that exceeds the bill‚Äôs definition of harm (such as causing $500 million in damage). That is practically impossible for any AI builder to ensure. If the bill is passed, it will stifle AI model builders, especially open source developers. 

Some AI applications, for example in healthcare, are risky. But as I wrote previously, regulators should regulate applications rather than technology.¬†
- Technology refers to tools that can be applied in many ways to solve various problems.
- Applications are specific implementations of technologies designed to meet particular customer needs.

For example, an electric motor is a technology. When we put it in a blender, an electric vehicle, dialysis machine, or guided bomb, it becomes an application. Imagine if we passed laws saying, if anyone uses a motor in a harmful way, the motor manufacturer is liable. Motor makers would either shut down or make motors so tiny as to be useless for most applications. If we pass such a law, sure, we might stop people from building guided bombs, but we‚Äôd also lose blenders, electric vehicles, and dialysis machines. In contrast, if we look at specific applications, like blenders, we can more rationally assess risks and figure out how to make sure they‚Äôre safe, and even ban classes of applications, like certain types of munitions. 

Safety is a property of the application, not a property of the technology (or model), as Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor have pointed out. Whether a blender is a safe one can‚Äôt be determined by examining the electric motor. A similar argument holds for AI.¬† 

SB-1047 doesn‚Äôt account for this distinction. It ignores the reality that the number of beneficial uses of AI models is, like electric motors, vastly greater than the number of harmful ones. But, just as no one knows how to build a motor that can‚Äôt be adapted to harmful applcations. For open models, there‚Äôs no known defense to fine-tuning to remove RLHF alignment. And jailbreaking work has shown that even closed-source, proprietary models can  be prompted harmful responses. Indeed, the sharp-witted Pliny the Prompter regularly tweets about jailbreaks for closed models. Kudos also to Anthropic‚Äôs Cem Anil and collaborators for publishing their work on many-shot jailbreaking, an attack seems hard to defend against. 

I hope you will speak out against SB-1047 it if you get a chance to do so.

Here, I‚Äôd like to share what might be a counter-intuitive best practice that I‚Äôve learned from leading AI Fund, a venture studio that has built dozens of startups with extraordinary entrepreneurs. When it comes to building AI applications, we strongly prefer to work on a concrete idea, meaning a specific product envisioned in enough detail that we can build it for a specific target user.

Some design philosophies say you shouldn‚Äôt envision a specific product from the start. Instead, they recommend starting with a problem to be solved and then carefully studying the market before you devise a concrete solution. There‚Äôs a reason for this: The more concrete or precise your product specification, the more likely it is to be off-target. However, I find that having something specific to execute toward lets you go much faster and discover and fix problems more rapidly along the way. If the idea turns out to be flawed, rapid execution will let you discover the flaws sooner, and this knowledge and experience will help you switch to a different concrete idea.

One test of concreteness is whether you‚Äôve specified the idea in enough detail that a product/engineering team could build an initial prototype. For example, ‚ÄúAI for livestock farming‚Äù is not concrete; it‚Äôs vague. If you were to ask an engineer to build this, they would have a hard time knowing what to build.  Similarly, ‚ÄúAI for livestock tracking in farming‚Äù is still vague. There are so many approaches to this that most reasonable engineers wouldn‚Äôt know what to build. But ‚ÄúApply face recognition to cows so as to recognize individual cows and monitor their movement on a farm‚Äù is specific enough that a good engineer could quickly choose from the available options (for example, what algorithm to try first, what camera resolution to use, and so on) to let us relatively efficiently assess:
- Technical feasibility: For example, do face recognition algorithms developed for human faces work for cows? (It turns out that they do!)
- Business feasibility: Does the idea add enough value to be worth building? (Talking to farmers might quickly reveal that solutions like RFID are easier and cheaper.)

Articulating a concrete idea ‚Äî which is more likely than a vague idea to be wrong ‚Äî takes more courage. The more specific an idea, the more likely it is to be a bit off, especially in the details. The general area of AI for livestock farming seems promising, and surely there will be good ways to apply AI for livestock. In contrast, specifying a concrete idea, which is much easier to invalidate, is scary.

The benefit is that the clarity of a specific product vision lets a team execute much faster. One strong predictor of how likely a startup is to succeed is the speed with which it can get stuff done.

10. End with the sentiment that soft skills are the hardest to automate and hence, invaluable.","In times when GPT can give you information and teach you everything from drafting social media posts to building a company as a solopreneur, gaining hard skills is easier than ever!

However, the importance of soft skills is quintessential now, making one stand out amongst millions of AI-generated literates. To create innovation and collaboration with humans and machines, interpersonal skills are more important than ever.

In my Kaizen process, I know the importance of soft skills is as much as, or even more than, hard skills. Decision-making is a skill that sculpts your life, and we are never taught this cardinal skill. It‚Äôs something we think just happens by intuition; it‚Äôs rather an art and a lot of science, and you can get better at it with the right approach.

An important lesson from the Decision Analytics course is that good decision-making can sometimes lead to bad outcomes. Therefore, making informed decisions based on data and research is crucial to avoid catastrophic and recurring failures. Excluding outcome sensitivity and focusing on the process to make the best decision with available information is crucial.

I was discussing my career trajectory with a well-wisher, and he suggested I build such skills mindfully and recommended this course. This course was a great start in aiding my journey as a data-driven leader at the helm of impactful decision-making.

Don‚Äôt turn a blind eye to your soft skills. Hone them to win this race against the bots.

Ask for it to be formatted as a coherent LinkedIn post.","Last week, I spoke about AI and regulations at an event at the U.S. Capitol attended by legislative and business leaders. I‚Äôm encouraged by the progress the open source community has made fending off regulations that would have stifled innovation. But opponents of open source are continuing to shift their arguments, with the latest worries centering on open source's impact on national security. I hope we‚Äôll all keep protecting open source! 

I‚Äôm encouraged by the progress the U.S. federal government has made getting a realistic grasp of AI‚Äôs risks. To be clear, guardrails are needed. But they should be applied to AI applications, not to general-purpose AI technology. 

Nonetheless, some companies are eager to limit open source, possibly to protect the value of massive investments they‚Äôve made in proprietary models and to deter competitors. It has been fascinating to watch their arguments change over time.

For instance, about 12 months ago, the Center For AI Safety‚Äôs ‚ÄúStatement on AI Risk‚Äù warned AI could cause human extinction and stoked fears of AI taking over. This alarmed leaders in Washington. But many people in AI pointed out that this dystopian science-fiction scenario had little basis in reality. About six months later, when I testified at the U.S. Senate‚Äôs AI Insight forum, legislators no longer worried much about an AI takeover.

Then the opponents of open source shifted gears. Their leading argument shifted to the risk of AI helping to create bioweapons. Soon afterward, OpenAI and RAND showed that current AI does not significantly increase the ability of malefactors to build bioweapons. This fear of AI-enabled bioweapons has diminished. To be sure, that bad actors could use bioweapons ‚Äî with or without AI ‚Äî remains a topic of great international concern. 

The latest argument for blocking open source AI has shifted to national security. AI is useful for both economic competition and warfare, and open source opponents say the U.S. should make sure its adversaries don‚Äôt have access to the latest foundation models. While I don‚Äôt want authoritarian governments to use AI, particularly to wage unjust wars, the LLM cat is out of the bag, and authoritarian countries will fill the vacuum if democratic nations limit access. When, some day, a child asks an AI system questions about democracy, the role of a free press, or an independent judiciary, I would like the AI to reflect democratic values rather those of authoritarian leaders. 

I came away from Washington optimistic about the progress we‚Äôve made defending open source. Looking beyond the U.S. federal government, there are many jurisdictions. Unfortunately, arguments for¬†regulations that would stifle AI  continue to proliferate. But talking to regulators does have an impact. If you have a chance to talk to a regulator, I hope you‚Äôll do what you can to help governments better understand AI.

438,"Generate a LinkedIn post summarizing recent advancements in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and the evolving best practices for prompting them. The post should cover:

1. Google's announcement about doubling the input context window of Gemini Pro 1.5 from 1 million to 2 million tokens.
2. OpenAI's release of GPT-4o, which generates tokens 2x faster and at 50% lower cost than GPT-4 Turbo, and its native capability to accept and generate multimodal tokens.
3. The trend over the past 18 months towards improved reasoning capabilities and longer input context windows. Highlight that newer models like GPT-4, Gemini Pro 1.5, Claude 3 Opus, and Llama 3-70B excel in these areas.
4. Discuss how the advanced reasoning capabilities of models allow them to handle complex prompts with detailed instructions, contrasting this with the simpler prompts typically used in LLM web interfaces.
5. Mention the advantages of longer input context windows for techniques like many-shot learning over few-shot learning and provide the input token capacities of current models (GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini Pro 1.5).
6. Outline a process for developing complex workflows with LLMs, starting from simple prompts and iteratively refining them, to possibly employing few-shot or many-shot learning, fine-tuning, or breaking tasks into subtasks.
7. Recommend further reading on prompting strategies, specifically the Medprompt paper by Nori et al., 2023.

The format should resemble a professional LinkedIn post and contain helpful insights for developers building applications with LLMs. Include a link to a relevant document if possible.","This week, Google announced a doubling of Gemini Pro 1.5's input context window from 1 million to 2 million tokens, and OpenAI released GPT-4o, which generates tokens 2x faster and 50% cheaper than GPT-4 Turbo and natively accepts and generates multimodal tokens. I view these developments as the latest in an 18-month trend, which is shifting prompting best practices for developers as well.

Since ChatGPT's launch in Nov 2022, newer models like GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3 Opus, and Llama 3-70B have given us better capabilities in two important ways: (i) reasoning, which allows LLMs to think through complex concepts and and follow complex instructions; and (ii) longer input context windows. 

The reasoning capability of advanced models makes them quite good at interpreting complex prompts with detailed instructions. Many people are used to dashing off a quick, 1- to 2-sentence query to an LLM. In contrast, when building applications, I see sophisticated teams frequently write prompts that might be 1 to 2 pages long (my teams call them ‚Äúmega-prompts‚Äù) that specify in detail how we‚Äôd like an LLM to perform a task. I still see teams not going far enough in terms of writing detailed instructions. For an example of a moderately lengthy prompt, take a look at Claude 3‚Äôs system prompt. It‚Äôs detailed and gives clear guidance for Claude's behavior. 

This is a very different prompting style than we typically use with LLMs‚Äô web user interfaces, where we might dash off a quick query and, if the response is unsatisfactory, clarify what we want through repeated conversational turns with the chatbot.

The increasing length of input context windows has added another technique to the developer‚Äôs toolkit. GPT-3 kicked off a lot of work on few-shot in-context learning. For example, for text classification, you might give the LLM a handful ‚Äî say 1 to 5 examples ‚Äî of texts and their class labels as context. With longer input context windows ‚Äî GPT-4o accepts 128,000 input tokens, Claude 3 Opus 200,000 tokens, and Gemini 1.5 Pro 1 million tokens (2 million just announced). With many-shot learning, we can give dozens, even hundreds of examples in the prompt, and this works better than few-shot. 

When building complex workflows, I see developers getting good results with this process:¬†
- Write quick, simple prompts and see how it does.
- Based on where the output falls short, flesh out the prompt iteratively. This  leads to a longer, more detailed, prompt, perhaps even a mega-prompt.
- If that‚Äôs still insufficient, consider few-shot or many-shot learning (if applicable) or, less frequently, fine-tuning.
- If that still doesn‚Äôt yield the results you need, break down the task into subtasks and apply an agentic workflow.

If you‚Äôre interested a deeper dive into prompting strategies, I recommend the Medprompt paper (Nori et al., 2023), which lays out a complex set of prompting strategies.

439,"Write a LinkedIn post highlighting the significance of AI agentic workflows in driving AI progress this year, potentially surpassing advancements in foundation models. Emphasize the current predominant use of LLMs in zero-shot mode and the limitations this approach has, akin to composing an essay without revisions. Explain how an agentic workflow can enhance performance by iterating over the document multiple times through planning, conducting web searches, drafting, reviewing, and revising.

Illustrate this with a recent example comparing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's performance on the HumanEval coding benchmark, showing that an iterative agent workflow significantly improves results. Mention the social media buzz around Devin's demo and your team's analysis, leading to findings that GPT-3.5 in an agent loop attains up to 95.1% accuracy.

Introduce a framework for categorizing AI agent design patterns your team at AI Fund uses, including:

- Reflection
- Tool use
- Planning
- Multi-agent collaboration

Conclude by mentioning you'll elaborate on these patterns and provide readings in a follow-up post. Include the original source link: [https://lnkd.in/gSFBby4q]","I think AI agentic workflows will drive massive AI progress this year ‚Äî perhaps even more than the next generation of foundation models. This is an important trend, and I urge everyone who works in AI to pay attention to it.

Today, we mostly use LLMs in zero-shot mode, prompting a model to generate final output token by token without revising its work. This is akin to asking someone to compose an essay from start to finish, typing straight through with no backspacing allowed, and expecting a high-quality result. Despite the difficulty, LLMs do amazingly well at this task!

With an agentic workflow, however, we can ask the LLM to iterate over a document many times. For example, it might take a sequence of steps such as:
- Plan an outline.
- Decide what, if any, web searches are needed to gather more information.
- Write a first draft.
- Read over the first draft to spot unjustified arguments or extraneous information.
- Revise the draft taking into account any weaknesses spotted.
- And so on.

This iterative process is critical for most human writers to write good text. With AI, such an iterative workflow yields much better results than writing in a single pass.

Devin‚Äôs splashy demo recently received a lot of social media buzz. My team has been closely following the evolution of AI that writes code. We analyzed results from a number of research teams, focusing on an algorithm‚Äôs ability to do well on the widely used HumanEval coding benchmark. You can see our findings in the diagram below. 

GPT-3.5 (zero shot) was 48.1% correct. GPT-4 (zero shot) does better at 67.0%. However, the improvement from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 is dwarfed by incorporating an iterative agent workflow. Indeed, wrapped in an agent loop, GPT-3.5 achieves up to 95.1%. 

Open source agent tools and the academic literature on agents are proliferating, making this an exciting time but also a confusing one. To help put this work into perspective, I‚Äôd like to share a framework for categorizing design patterns for building agents. My team AI Fund is successfully using these patterns in many applications, and I hope you find them useful.

- Reflection: The LLM examines its own work to come up with ways to improve it.
- Tool use: The LLM is given tools such as web search, code execution, or any other function to help it gather information, take action, or process data.
- Planning: The LLM comes up with, and executes, a multistep plan to achieve a goal (for example, writing an outline for an essay, then doing online research, then writing a draft, and so on).
- Multi-agent collaboration: More than one AI agent work together, splitting up tasks and discussing and debating ideas, to come up with better solutions than a single agent would.

I‚Äôll elaborate on these design patterns and offer suggested readings for each next week.

We sometimes overthink and mess up things or hype it a lot and later realize it was a piece of cake.I also sometimes become anxious about new things. Through my experiences I felt we can handle these feelings in the following way.Research:Do some research about incoming opportunities beforehand. Try to gather as much information as possible, so that you'll know what it is going to be already.Seek Guidance:Ask about it to your seniors who already have gone through it. Your mentors can also help you. Discuss with your friends, you'll get to know you're not alone in this.Prepare and Plan:Plan your stuff according to gathered information. Preparing in advance can reduce uncertainty and boost your confidence.Take Small Steps:Break down new tasks or challenges into smaller, manageable steps. This can make them feel less overwhelming.Focus on the Positive:Remind yourself of past successes when you overcame challenges. Trust in your ability to handle new situations.Stay Resilient:If you fear a lot about failure, then already train your mind to ask a question what I'll do if I fail?Facing every opportunity to win but always being resilient to failures, being well prepared, having a plan and learning mindset is the key.

Key takeaways from my exploration so far:

1) Some may resist the reality that AI is here to stay, but the wise approach is to guide its potential toward positive outcomes.

2) Go beyond listening‚Äîuncover user needs they may not even realize themselves.

3) Success in tech-driven projects hinges on bridging the gap between domain experts and technologists, fostering diverse teams that respect and learn from each other.

4) Creating human-centric solutions often means embracing advanced tech. This journey taught me to overcome mental barriers and harness the synergy of design, expertise, and technology for impactful innovation.

1) The most effective approach to embracing AI is to harness its potential towards positive outcomes, rather than fearing its implications.

2) A key distinction lies in transcending mere listening and instead uncovering user needs that may remain unconscious.

3) The success of tech-driven projects hinges on bridging the gap between domain experts and technologists, cultivating diverse teams that respect and learn from one another.

4) Creating human-centric solutions often necessitates embracing cutting-edge technologies. Through this journey, I've learned to overcome mental barriers and capitalize on the synergy between design, expertise, and technology to drive impactful innovation.

As a child, I once held IT as the pinnacle of career aspirations ‚Äì renowned for its prestige, lucrative compensation, and widespread opportunities. This narrative held true for years, with the tech industry experiencing rapid growth, companies expanding their reach, and job prospects abound.

However, nearly five years into my own IT career, I have observed a significant transformation. Many professionals are now openly discussing their desire to transition away from this field. I've spoken with colleagues who aspire to leave behind the corporate world and establish a business in their hometowns, driven by a desire for independence and stability. Concurrently, companies are significantly reducing staff, casting doubt on job security.

Recently, I received guidance on navigating these situations, which I'd like to share with others who may be facing similar concerns. It's easy to overthink and magnify the significance of uncertain events, only to realize later that they were manageable and not as daunting as initially perceived.

To mitigate such anxiety, I recommend the following strategies:

Research: Proactively gather information about incoming opportunities before diving in. This will help you better understand what to expect and reduce uncertainty.

Seek Guidance: Reach out to experienced professionals who have navigated similar situations. Your seniors, mentors, or friends can offer valuable insights and reassurance that you're not alone.

Prepare and Plan: Utilize the knowledge gathered through research to create a plan of action. This will help boost your confidence and prepare you for potential outcomes.

Take Small Steps: Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. By doing so, you'll make them feel less overwhelming and more achievable.

Focus on the Positive: Reflect on past successes and remind yourself of your ability to overcome challenges. Trust in your capacity to handle new situations and bounce back from setbacks.

Stay Resilient: Cultivate a mindset that views failure as an opportunity for growth. Train yourself to ask, ""What would I do if I failed?"" and focus on learning and adaptation rather than fear of defeat. This resilience is key to successfully navigating new challenges.

In the face of uncertainty, it's essential to be honest with yourself about what you truly want and need. If your actions don't align with your priorities, it's time for a self-reflection. Your actions reveal your true motivations and desires; take ownership of them and start working towards making them a reality.

When a request is made that seems to defy conventional wisdom, how do you respond? I recall a recent encounter where a client requested an unconventional design aesthetic, one that strayed from the traditional ""make it pop"" approach. The term used was ""jhakkass,"" which can be a bit difficult for non-local clients to grasp.

As professionals, we must strike a balance between creativity and pragmatism. While it's essential to challenge ourselves and explore new ideas, we also need to consider the client's specific needs and goals. By embracing this nuance, we can deliver solutions that not only meet but exceed expectations.

In today's fast-paced business landscape, being adaptable and open-minded is crucial. It's okay to say ""no"" to requests that don't align with our core competencies or values. However, it's equally important to engage in thoughtful discussions about what the client truly needs, rather than simply dismissing their ideas.

I'm excited to share my latest publication, which takes motion detection to the next level by integrating cutting-edge technologies such as real-time tracking and object recognition. By doing so, I developed a revolutionary Smart Detectors System (SDS) that not only detects movement but also identifies objects in real-time.

The key differentiator of our system lies in its sensor fusion capabilities. The closer an object is to the sensor, the more precise the detection becomes, while reducing intensity if it's far away. This enables our system to provide real-time intelligence and adapt to situations with varying levels of threat.

Furthermore, our SDS features a 90-degree rotation mechanism that adds an extra layer of interactivity when motion is detected. This makes it particularly suitable for applications such as automated doors, security systems, and robotics. Imagine harnessing this technology to create innovative solutions in real-world settings!

The possibilities are endless with our Real-Time, Adaptive System (RTAS), which is designed to excel in areas like home security, automation, and futuristic robotics. I'm currently exploring new ideas, including wireless connectivity and AI-based detection, to further enhance its capabilities.

Recently, I received an email acknowledging this common sentiment, suggesting seeking support for managing similar feelings. It's essential to acknowledge that we often overcomplicate matters or become overwhelmed by our own thoughts, only to later discover that the solution was more straightforward than anticipated.

Through my personal experiences, I've learned valuable strategies for coping with anxiety and uncertainty when facing new situations. Firstly, conducting thorough research can provide valuable insights and help alleviate concerns. Seeking guidance from experienced individuals who have navigated similar challenges can also be incredibly beneficial.

Effective preparation and planning are key to reducing uncertainty and boosting confidence. Breaking down daunting tasks into manageable steps can make them feel less overwhelming, while focusing on past successes can serve as a powerful reminder of one's capabilities. Furthermore, cultivating a resilient mindset, where failure is viewed as an opportunity for growth rather than a source of fear, is essential for navigating new challenges.

It's time to acknowledge that our actions often reveal more about our true motivations and desires than we care to admit. If you keep expressing a desire for something but fail to take concrete steps towards achieving it, ask yourself: what am I truly driven by? What steps can I take today to move closer to my goals? By embracing this mindset and taking proactive action, you'll be better equipped to overcome anxiety and unlock your full potential.

My perception of the IT industry as an ideal career path has undergone a significant transformation over the years. As a child, I believed that working in IT would be the ultimate aspiration ‚Äì offering high remuneration, respect, and opportunities for every college graduate. Unfortunately, this narrative has not held true in recent times.

In fact, I've noticed a marked shift in the past five years. While many individuals still aspire to break into the field, an increasing number of professionals are considering alternative paths. Some colleagues have expressed a desire to start their own businesses in their hometowns, driven by a quest for independence and stability. Conversely, companies are laying off employees on a large scale, casting doubt on job security.
So, what has contributed to this shift? Is it the dynamic nature of the job market, the pressures of corporate life, or the realization that true passion lies elsewhere?
I'd appreciate hearing your perspectives on this topic. Are you still pursuing an IT career, or are you exploring options for a career transition?"

990,Write a medium LinkedIn post on Managing anxiety and uncertainty in professional development that conveys a motivational message,"As I navigate the complexities of emerging opportunities and challenges, I've come to realize that anxiety can be a pervasive obstacle. Recently, I had the privilege of receiving valuable guidance on managing these feelings, which I'd like to share with others who may be grappling with similar concerns.

It's easy to get caught up in overthinking and magnifying the significance of uncertain events, only to discover later that they were manageable and not as daunting as initially perceived. To mitigate this anxiety, I've found several strategies to be highly effective:

Proactively gathering information about incoming opportunities through research can provide a clear understanding of what to expect, thereby reducing uncertainty.

Seeking guidance from experienced professionals who have navigated similar situations can offer valuable insights and reassurance that you're not alone in your journey. Reaching out to seniors, mentors, or friends can be an excellent way to tap into their expertise and gain new perspectives.

Preparing and planning for potential outcomes by utilizing the knowledge gathered through research can significantly boost confidence and help prepare one for various scenarios.

Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps can make them feel less overwhelming and more achievable. By doing so, you'll be able to tackle seemingly insurmountable challenges with greater ease.

Focusing on past successes and reminding yourself of your ability to overcome challenges can instill a sense of confidence in the face of uncertainty. Reflecting on these experiences can help you trust in your capacity to handle new situations and bounce back from setbacks.

Cultivating a growth mindset by viewing failure as an opportunity for growth rather than fear of defeat is essential for successfully navigating new challenges. By asking yourself, ""What would I do if I failed?"", and focusing on learning and adaptation rather than fear, you'll be better equipped to handle uncertainty with resilience.

It's equally important to take ownership of your actions and prioritize what truly matters to you. If your actions don't align with your priorities, it's time for self-reflection. By being honest with yourself about your true desires and needs, you can create a clear path forward and make progress towards making them a reality.

Recently, I was fortunate enough to receive valuable guidance on managing anxiety in the face of ambiguity, which I'd like to share with others who may be facing similar concerns.

It's easy to get caught up in overthinking and magnifying the significance of uncertain events, only to discover later that they were manageable and not as daunting as initially perceived. To mitigate such anxiety, I've found the following strategies to be particularly effective:

Conduct thorough research: Proactively gathering information about incoming opportunities can help demystify uncertainty and reduce feelings of unease.

Seek expert guidance: Reaching out to experienced professionals who have navigated similar situations can provide invaluable insights and reassurance that you're not alone in your journey.

Develop a plan: Leveraging the knowledge gained through research, create a comprehensive plan of action that empowers confidence and prepares you for potential outcomes.

Break tasks into manageable steps: By dissecting complex challenges into smaller, more achievable components, you'll be able to tackle them with greater ease and reduce feelings of overwhelm.

Focus on past successes: Reflecting on your past achievements can help reinforce your capacity for resilience and remind you that you're equipped to handle new situations. Cultivate a growth mindset by trusting in your ability to adapt and learn from setbacks.

Maintain a resilient mindset: View failure as an opportunity for growth, rather than defeat. Ask yourself ""what would I do if I failed?"" and focus on learning and adaptation rather than fear of failure. This resilience is essential for successfully navigating new challenges.

Be honest with yourself about your priorities: Take the time to reflect on what truly drives you and what you want to achieve. If your actions don't align with your goals, it's essential to re-evaluate and make necessary adjustments. Your actions reveal your true motivations and desires; take ownership of them and start working towards making them a reality.

Together, let's cultivate growth, collaboration, and empowerment. By supporting one another, we can rise above uncertainty and achieve our goals as a cohesive unit. #GrowthMindset #Collaboration #Empowerment #Innovation #RiseTogether"

In the pursuit of delivering exceptional results, professionals often face a delicate dilemma when presented with unconventional requests. I recently encountered a situation where a client proposed an innovative design aesthetic that diverged from traditional approaches. The term ""jhakkass,"" although unfamiliar to non-local clients, underscores the importance of cultural sensitivity and adaptability.

As professionals, it is essential to strike a balance between pushing boundaries and meeting specific client needs. By embracing this nuanced approach, we can create solutions that not only meet but exceed expectations. It's equally important to recognize when requests fall outside our core competencies or values, and respectfully communicate these limitations.

Effective communication and collaboration are critical in such situations. Rather than dismissing a client's ideas outright, it's crucial to engage in thoughtful discussions about their true requirements. By doing so, we can build trust, foster deeper relationships, and ultimately drive more successful outcomes in today's fast-paced business landscape."

As a child, I was drawn to the IT industry as a pinnacle of professional aspiration - characterized by its prestige, financial rewards, and extensive opportunities. This narrative persisted for years, with the tech sector experiencing exponential growth, companies expanding globally, and job prospects seeming virtually limitless.

However, nearly five years into my own IT career, I've observed a profound shift in the industry's dynamics.

Concurrently, companies are significantly reducing staff, casting doubt on job security and forcing professionals to reassess their career goals.
The question remains: what is driving this shift? Is it the changing nature of the job market, the pressures of corporate life, or the realization that individual passions and interests lie outside the IT sector?

Recently, I was fortunate to receive insightful guidance on mitigating these feelings, which I'd like to share with others who may be struggling with similar concerns.

It's easy to become mired in overthinking and amplifying the significance of uncertain events, only to discover later that they were more manageable than initially perceived. To overcome this anxiety, I've found several strategies to be highly effective:

Conducting thorough research on incoming opportunities can provide a clear understanding of what to expect, thereby reducing uncertainty and uncertainty-driven stress.

Seeking guidance from experienced professionals who have navigated similar situations can offer valuable insights and reassurance that you're not alone in your journey. Leveraging the expertise of seniors, mentors, or friends can be an excellent way to tap into their knowledge and gain new perspectives.

Developing a plan for potential outcomes by utilizing the knowledge gathered through research can significantly boost confidence and help prepare one for various scenarios. This proactive approach can empower individuals to tackle complex challenges with greater ease.

Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps can make them feel less overwhelming and more achievable. By doing so, you'll be able to tackle seemingly insurmountable challenges with greater resilience.

Focusing on past successes and reminding yourself of your ability to overcome challenges can instill a sense of confidence in the face of uncertainty. Reflecting on these experiences can help you trust in your capacity to handle new situations and bounce back from setbacks.

Cultivating a growth mindset by viewing failure as an opportunity for growth rather than fear of defeat is essential for successfully navigating new challenges. By asking yourself, ""What would I do if I failed?"", and focusing on learning and adaptation rather than fear, you'll be better equipped to handle uncertainty with resilience.

It's equally important to take ownership of your actions and prioritize what truly matters to you. If your actions don't align with your priorities, it's time for self-reflection. By being honest with yourself about your true desires and needs, you can create a clear path forward and make progress towards making them a reality.

Concurrently, companies are reducing staff at an alarming rate, casting a shadow of uncertainty over job security and exacerbating concerns about career stability.

Is it the dynamic nature of the job market, the pressures of modern corporate life, or the growing realization that individual passions lie beyond the scope of conventional IT careers?
